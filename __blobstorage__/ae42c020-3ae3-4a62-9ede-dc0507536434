didYouMean.js - A simple JavaScript matching engine
===================================================

[Available on GitHub](https://github.com/dcporter/didyoumean.js).

A super-simple, highly optimized JS library for matching human-quality input to a list of potential
matches. You can use it to suggest a misspelled command-line utility option to a user, or to offer
links to nearby valid URLs on your 404 page. (The examples below are taken from a personal project,
my [HTML5 business card](http://dcporter.aws.af.cm/me), which uses didYouMean.js to suggest correct
URLs from misspelled ones, such as [dcporter.aws.af.cm/me/instagarm](http://dcporter.aws.af.cm/me/instagarm).)
Uses the [Levenshtein distance algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance).

didYouMean.js works in the browser as well as in node.js. To install it for use in node:

```
npm install didyoumean
```


Examples
--------

Matching against a list of strings:
```
var input = 'insargrm'
var list = ['facebook', 'twitter', 'instagram', 'linkedin'];
console.log(didYouMean(input, list));
> 'instagram'
// The method matches 'insargrm' to 'instagram'.

input = 'google plus';
console.log(didYouMean(input, list));
> null
// The method was unable to find 'google plus' in the list of options.
```

Matching against a list of objects:
```
var input = 'insargrm';
var list = [ { id: 'facebook' }, { id: 'twitter' }, { id: 'instagram' }, { id: 'linkedin' } ];
var key = 'id';
console.log(didYouMean(input, list, key));
> 'instagram'
// The method returns the matching value.

didYouMean.returnWinningObject = true;
console.log(didYouMean(input, list, key));
> { id: 'instagram' }
// The method returns the matching object.
```


didYouMean(str, list, [key])
----------------------------

- str: The string input to match.
- list: An array of strings or objects to match against.
- key (OPTIONAL): If your list array contains objects, you must specify the key which contains the string
  to match against.

Returns: the closest matching string, or null if no strings exceed the threshold.


Options
-------

Options are set on the didYouMean function object. You may change them at any time.

### threshold

  By default, the method will only return strings whose edit distance is less than 40% (0.4x) of their length.
  For example, if a ten-letter string is five edits away from its nearest match, the method will return null.

  You can control this by setting the "threshold" value on the didYouMean function. For example, to set the
  edit distance threshold to 50% of the input string's length:

  ```
  didYouMean.threshold = 0.5;
  ```

  To return the nearest match no matter the threshold, set this value to null.

### thresholdAbsolute

  This option behaves the same as threshold, but instead takes an integer number of edit steps. For example,
  if thresholdAbsolute is set to 20 (the default), then the method will only return strings whose edit distance
  is less than 20. Both options apply.

### caseSensitive

  By default, the method will perform case-insensitive comparisons. If you wish to force case sensitivity, set
  the "caseSensitive" value to true:

  ```
  didYouMean.caseSensitive = true;
  ```

### nullResultValue

  By default, the method will return null if there is no sufficiently close match. You can change this value here.

### returnWinningObject

  By default, the method will return the winning string value (if any). If your list contains objects rather
  than strings, you may set returnWinningObject to true.
  
  ```
  didYouMean.returnWinningObject = true;
  ```
  
  This option has no effect on lists of strings.

### returnFirstMatch
  
  By default, the method will search all values and return the closest match. If you're simply looking for a "good-
  enough" match, you can set your thresholds appropriately and set returnFirstMatch to true to substantially speed
  things up.

## Install

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the
[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). Installation is done using the
[`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

```sh
$ npm install serve-static
```

## API

```js
var serveStatic = require('serve-static')
```

### serveStatic(root, options)

Create a new middleware function to serve files from within a given root
directory. The file to serve will be determined by combining `req.url`
with the provided root directory. When a file is not found, instead of
sending a 404 response, this module will instead call `next()` to move on
to the next middleware, allowing for stacking and fall-backs.

#### Options

##### acceptRanges

Enable or disable accepting ranged requests, defaults to true.
Disabling this will not send `Accept-Ranges` and ignore the contents
of the `Range` request header.

##### cacheControl

Enable or disable setting `Cache-Control` response header, defaults to
true. Disabling this will ignore the `immutable` and `maxAge` options.

##### dotfiles

 Set how "dotfiles" are treated when encountered. A dotfile is a file
or directory that begins with a dot ("."). Note this check is done on
the path itself without checking if the path actually exists on the
disk. If `root` is specified, only the dotfiles above the root are
checked (i.e. the root itself can be within a dotfile when set
to "deny").

  - `'allow'` No special treatment for dotfiles.
  - `'deny'` Deny a request for a dotfile and 403/`next()`.
  - `'ignore'` Pretend like the dotfile does not exist and 404/`next()`.

The default value is similar to `'ignore'`, with the exception that this
default will not ignore the files within a directory that begins with a dot.

##### etag

Enable or disable etag generation, defaults to true.

##### extensions

Set file extension fallbacks. When set, if a file is not found, the given
extensions will be added to the file name and search for. The first that
exists will be served. Example: `['html', 'htm']`.

The default value is `false`.

##### fallthrough

Set the middleware to have client errors fall-through as just unhandled
requests, otherwise forward a client error. The difference is that client
errors like a bad request or a request to a non-existent file will cause
this middleware to simply `next()` to your next middleware when this value
is `true`. When this value is `false`, these errors (even 404s), will invoke
`next(err)`.

Typically `true` is desired such that multiple physical directories can be
mapped to the same web address or for routes to fill in non-existent files.

The value `false` can be used if this middleware is mounted at a path that
is designed to be strictly a single file system directory, which allows for
short-circuiting 404s for less overhead. This middleware will also reply to
all methods.

The default value is `true`.

##### immutable

Enable or disable the `immutable` directive in the `Cache-Control` response
header, defaults to `false`. If set to `true`, the `maxAge` option should
also be specified to enable caching. The `immutable` directive will prevent
supported clients from making conditional requests during the life of the
`maxAge` option to check if the file has changed.

##### index

By default this module will send "index.html" files in response to a request
on a directory. To disable this set `false` or to supply a new index pass a
string or an array in preferred order.

##### lastModified

Enable or disable `Last-Modified` header, defaults to true. Uses the file
system's last modified value.

##### maxAge

Provide a max-age in milliseconds for http caching, defaults to 0. This
can also be a string accepted by the [ms](https://www.npmjs.org/package/ms#readme)
module.

##### redirect

Redirect to trailing "/" when the pathname is a dir. Defaults to `true`.

##### setHeaders

Function to set custom headers on response. Alterations to the headers need to
occur synchronously. The function is called as `fn(res, path, stat)`, where
the arguments are:

  - `res` the response object
  - `path` the file path that is being sent
  - `stat` the stat object of the file that is being sent

## Examples

### Serve files with vanilla node.js http server

```js
var finalhandler = require('finalhandler')
var http = require('http')
var serveStatic = require('serve-static')

// Serve up public/ftp folder
var serve = serveStatic('public/ftp', { index: ['index.html', 'index.htm'] })

// Create server
var server = http.createServer(function onRequest (req, res) {
  serve(req, res, finalhandler(req, res))
})

// Listen
server.listen(3000)
```

### Serve all files as downloads

```js
var contentDisposition = require('content-disposition')
var finalhandler = require('finalhandler')
var http = require('http')
var serveStatic = require('serve-static')

// Serve up public/ftp folder
var serve = serveStatic('public/ftp', {
  index: false,
  setHeaders: setHeaders
})

// Set header to force download
function setHeaders (res, path) {
  res.setHeader('Content-Disposition', contentDisposition(path))
}

// Create server
var server = http.createServer(function onRequest (req, res) {
  serve(req, res, finalhandler(req, res))
})

// Listen
server.listen(3000)
```

### Serving using express

#### Simple

This is a simple example of using Express.

```js
var express = require('express')
var serveStatic = require('serve-static')

var app = express()

app.use(serveStatic('public/ftp', { index: ['default.html', 'default.htm'] }))
app.listen(3000)
```

#### Multiple roots

This example shows a simple way to search through multiple directories.
Files are searched for in `public-optimized/` first, then `public/` second
as a fallback.

```js
var express = require('express')
var path = require('path')
var serveStatic = require('serve-static')

var app = express()

app.use(serveStatic(path.join(__dirname, 'public-optimized')))
app.use(serveStatic(path.join(__dirname, 'public')))
app.listen(3000)
```

#### Different settings for paths

This example shows how to set a different max age depending on the served
file type. In this example, HTML files are not cached, while everything else
is for 1 day.

```js
var express = require('express')
var path = require('path')
var serveStatic = require('serve-static')

var app = express()

app.use(serveStatic(path.join(__dirname, 'public'), {
  maxAge: '1d',
  setHeaders: setCustomCacheControl
}))

app.listen(3000)

function setCustomCacheControl (res, path) {
  if (serveStatic.mime.lookup(path) === 'text/html') {
    // Custom Cache-Control for HTML files
    res.setHeader('Cache-Control', 'public, max-age=0')
  }
}
```

let copyWithin;
let concat;
with ([]) {
    assert.equal(concat, Array.prototype.concat);
    assert.notEqual(copyWithin, Array.prototype.copyWithin);
}

shimUnscopables('concat');

with ([]) {
    assert.notEqual(concat, Array.prototype.concat);
    assert.notEqual(copyWithin, Array.prototype.copyWithin);
}
```

# CC0 1.0 Universal

## Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator and
subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an âownerâ) of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a âWorkâ).

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for the
purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and scientific works
(âCommonsâ) that the public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works, reuse and
redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever and for any purposes,
including without limitation commercial purposes. These owners may contribute
to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to gain reputation or
greater distribution for their Work in part through the use and efforts of
others.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any expectation of
additional consideration or compensation, the person associating CC0 with a
Work (the âAffirmerâ), to the extent that he or she is an owner of Copyright
and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply CC0 to the Work and
publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with knowledge of his or her
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
effect of CC0 on those rights.

1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
   protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (âCopyright and
   Related Rightsâ). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not limited
   to, the following:
   1. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate,
      and translate a Work;
   2. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
   3. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a personâs image or likeness
      depicted in a Work;
   4. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
      subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(i), below;
   5. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data in
      a Work;
   6. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
      European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
      protection of databases, and under any national implementation thereof,
      including any amended or successor version of such directive); and
   7. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the world
      based on applicable law or treaty, and any national implementations
      thereof.

2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of,
   applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
   unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of Affirmerâs Copyright
   and Related Rights and associated claims and causes of action, whether now
   known or unknown (including existing as well as future claims and causes of
   action), in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the maximum
   duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the âWaiverâ). Affirmer
   makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public at large and
   to the detriment of Affirmerâs heirs and successors, fully intending that
   such Waiver shall not be subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation,
   termination, or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
   enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by Affirmerâs express
   Statement of Purpose.

3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason be
   judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver
   shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
   Affirmerâs express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the extent the
   Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected person a
   royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
   irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmerâs Copyright and
   Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
   maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future time
   extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number of
   copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without limitation
   commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the âLicenseâ). The License
   shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was applied by Affirmer to the
   Work. Should any part of the License for any reason be judged legally
   invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
   ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the License, and in
   such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she will not (i) exercise any
   of his or her remaining Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii)
   assert any associated claims and causes of action with respect to the Work,
   in either case contrary to Affirmerâs express Statement of Purpose.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
   1. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
      surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
   2. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or warranties
      of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied, statutory or
      otherwise, including without limitation warranties of title,
      merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or
      the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present or
      absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to the greatest
      extent permissible under applicable law.
   3. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
      that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
      limitation any personâs Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
      Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
      consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the Work.
   4. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
      party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to this
      CC0 or use of the Work.

# cssesc [![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/mathiasbynens/cssesc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mathiasbynens/cssesc) [![Code coverage status](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/mathiasbynens/cssesc.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/mathiasbynens/cssesc)

A JavaScript library for escaping CSS strings and identifiers while generating the shortest possible ASCII-only output.

This is a JavaScript library for [escaping text for use in CSS strings or identifiers](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/css-escapes) while generating the shortest possible valid ASCII-only output. [Hereâs an online demo.](https://mothereff.in/css-escapes)

[A polyfill for the CSSOM `CSS.escape()` method is available in a separate repository.](https://mths.be/cssescape) (In comparison, _cssesc_ is much more powerful.)

Feel free to fork if you see possible improvements!

## Installation

Via [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```bash
npm install cssesc
```

In a browser:

```html
<script src="cssesc.js"></script>
```

In [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/):

```js
const cssesc = require('cssesc');
```

In Ruby using [the `ruby-cssesc` wrapper gem](https://github.com/borodean/ruby-cssesc):

```bash
gem install ruby-cssesc
```

```ruby
require 'ruby-cssesc'
CSSEsc.escape('I â¥ Ruby', is_identifier: true)
```

In Sass using [`sassy-escape`](https://github.com/borodean/sassy-escape):

```bash
gem install sassy-escape
```

```scss
body {
  content: escape('I â¥ Sass', $is-identifier: true);
}
```

## API

### `cssesc(value, options)`

This function takes a value and returns an escaped version of the value where any characters that are not printable ASCII symbols are escaped using the shortest possible (but valid) [escape sequences for use in CSS strings or identifiers](https://mathiasbynens.be/notes/css-escapes).

```js
cssesc('Ich â¥ BÃ¼cher');
// â 'Ich \\2665  B\\FC cher'

cssesc('foo ð bar');
// â 'foo \\1D306  bar'
```

By default, `cssesc` returns a string that can be used as part of a CSS string. If the target is a CSS identifier rather than a CSS string, use the `isIdentifier: true` setting (see below).

The optional `options` argument accepts an object with the following options:

#### `isIdentifier`

The default value for the `isIdentifier` option is `false`. This means that the input text will be escaped for use in a CSS string literal. If you want to use the result as a CSS identifier instead (in a selector, for example), set this option to `true`.

```js
cssesc('123a2b');
// â '123a2b'

cssesc('123a2b', {
  'isIdentifier': true
});
// â '\\31 23a2b'
```

#### `quotes`

The default value for the `quotes` option is `'single'`. This means that any occurences of `'` in the input text will be escaped as `\'`, so that the output can be used in a CSS string literal wrapped in single quotes.

```js
cssesc('Lorem ipsum "dolor" sit \'amet\' etc.');
// â 'Lorem ipsum "dolor" sit \\\'amet\\\' etc.'
// â "Lorem ipsum \"dolor\" sit \\'amet\\' etc."

cssesc('Lorem ipsum "dolor" sit \'amet\' etc.', {
  'quotes': 'single'
});
// â 'Lorem ipsum "dolor" sit \\\'amet\\\' etc.'
// â "Lorem ipsum \"dolor\" sit \\'amet\\' etc."
```

If you want to use the output as part of a CSS string literal wrapped in double quotes, set the `quotes` option to `'double'`.

```js
cssesc('Lorem ipsum "dolor" sit \'amet\' etc.', {
  'quotes': 'double'
});
// â 'Lorem ipsum \\"dolor\\" sit \'amet\' etc.'
// â "Lorem ipsum \\\"dolor\\\" sit 'amet' etc."
```

#### `wrap`

The `wrap` option takes a boolean value (`true` or `false`), and defaults to `false` (disabled). When enabled, the output will be a valid CSS string literal wrapped in quotes. The type of quotes can be specified through the `quotes` setting.

```js
cssesc('Lorem ipsum "dolor" sit \'amet\' etc.', {
  'quotes': 'single',
  'wrap': true
});
// â '\'Lorem ipsum "dolor" sit \\\'amet\\\' etc.\''
// â "\'Lorem ipsum \"dolor\" sit \\\'amet\\\' etc.\'"

cssesc('Lorem ipsum "dolor" sit \'amet\' etc.', {
  'quotes': 'double',
  'wrap': true
});
// â '"Lorem ipsum \\"dolor\\" sit \'amet\' etc."'
// â "\"Lorem ipsum \\\"dolor\\\" sit \'amet\' etc.\""
```

#### `escapeEverything`

The `escapeEverything` option takes a boolean value (`true` or `false`), and defaults to `false` (disabled). When enabled, all the symbols in the output will be escaped, even printable ASCII symbols.

```js
cssesc('lolwat"foo\'bar', {
  'escapeEverything': true
});
// â '\\6C\\6F\\6C\\77\\61\\74\\"\\66\\6F\\6F\\\'\\62\\61\\72'
// â "\\6C\\6F\\6C\\77\\61\\74\\\"\\66\\6F\\6F\\'\\62\\61\\72"
```

#### Overriding the default options globally

The global default settings can be overridden by modifying the `css.options` object. This saves you from passing in an `options` object for every call to `encode` if you want to use the non-default setting.

```js
// Read the global default setting for `escapeEverything`:
cssesc.options.escapeEverything;
// â `false` by default

// Override the global default setting for `escapeEverything`:
cssesc.options.escapeEverything = true;

// Using the global default setting for `escapeEverything`, which is now `true`:
cssesc('foo Â© bar â  baz ð qux');
// â '\\66\\6F\\6F\\ \\A9\\ \\62\\61\\72\\ \\2260\\ \\62\\61\\7A\\ \\1D306\\ \\71\\75\\78'
```

### `cssesc.version`

A string representing the semantic version number.

### Using the `cssesc` binary

To use the `cssesc` binary in your shell, simply install cssesc globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g cssesc
```

After that you will be able to escape text for use in CSS strings or identifiers from the command line:

```bash
$ cssesc 'fÃ¶o â¥ bÃ¥r ð baz'
f\F6o \2665  b\E5r \1D306  baz
```

If the output needs to be a CSS identifier rather than part of a string literal, use the `-i`/`--identifier` option:

```bash
$ cssesc --identifier 'fÃ¶o â¥ bÃ¥r ð baz'
f\F6o\ \2665\ b\E5r\ \1D306\ baz
```

See `cssesc --help` for the full list of options.

## Support

This library supports the Node.js and browser versions mentioned in [`.babelrc`](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/cssesc/blob/master/.babelrc). For a version that supports a wider variety of legacy browsers and environments out-of-the-box, [see v0.1.0](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/cssesc/releases/tag/v0.1.0).

    jsdom
</h1>

jsdom is a pure-JavaScript implementation of many web standards, notably the WHATWG [DOM](https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/) and [HTML](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/) Standards, for use with Node.js. In general, the goal of the project is to emulate enough of a subset of a web browser to be useful for testing and scraping real-world web applications.

The latest versions of jsdom require Node.js v10 or newer. (Versions of jsdom below v16 still work with previous Node.js versions, but are unsupported.)

## Basic usage

```js
const jsdom = require("jsdom");
const { JSDOM } = jsdom;
```

To use jsdom, you will primarily use the `JSDOM` constructor, which is a named export of the jsdom main module. Pass the constructor a string. You will get back a `JSDOM` object, which has a number of useful properties, notably `window`:

```js
const dom = new JSDOM(`<!DOCTYPE html><p>Hello world</p>`);
console.log(dom.window.document.querySelector("p").textContent); // "Hello world"
```

(Note that jsdom will parse the HTML you pass it just like a browser does, including implied `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags.)

The resulting object is an instance of the `JSDOM` class, which contains a number of useful properties and methods besides `window`. In general, it can be used to act on the jsdom from the "outside," doing things that are not possible with the normal DOM APIs. For simple cases, where you don't need any of this functionality, we recommend a coding pattern like

```js
const { window } = new JSDOM(`...`);
// or even
const { document } = (new JSDOM(`...`)).window;
```

Full documentation on everything you can do with the `JSDOM` class is below, in the section "`JSDOM` Object API".

## Customizing jsdom

The `JSDOM` constructor accepts a second parameter which can be used to customize your jsdom in the following ways.

### Simple options

```js
const dom = new JSDOM(``, {
  url: "https://example.org/",
  referrer: "https://example.com/",
  contentType: "text/html",
  includeNodeLocations: true,
  storageQuota: 10000000
});
```

- `url` sets the value returned by `window.location`, `document.URL`, and `document.documentURI`, and affects things like resolution of relative URLs within the document and the same-origin restrictions and referrer used while fetching subresources. It defaults to `"about:blank"`.
- `referrer` just affects the value read from `document.referrer`. It defaults to no referrer (which reflects as the empty string).
- `contentType` affects the value read from `document.contentType`, as well as how the document is parsed: as HTML or as XML. Values that are not a [HTML mime type](https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/#html-mime-type) or an [XML mime type](https://mimesniff.spec.whatwg.org/#xml-mime-type) will throw. It defaults to `"text/html"`. If a `charset` parameter is present, it can affect [binary data processing](#encoding-sniffing).
- `includeNodeLocations` preserves the location info produced by the HTML parser, allowing you to retrieve it with the `nodeLocation()` method (described below). It also ensures that line numbers reported in exception stack traces for code running inside `<script>` elements are correct. It defaults to `false` to give the best performance, and cannot be used with an XML content type since our XML parser does not support location info.
- `storageQuota` is the maximum size in code units for the separate storage areas used by `localStorage` and `sessionStorage`. Attempts to store data larger than this limit will cause a `DOMException` to be thrown. By default, it is set to 5,000,000 code units per origin, as inspired by the HTML specification.

Note that both `url` and `referrer` are canonicalized before they're used, so e.g. if you pass in `"https:example.com"`, jsdom will interpret that as if you had given `"https://example.com/"`. If you pass an unparseable URL, the call will throw. (URLs are parsed and serialized according to the [URL Standard](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/).)

### Executing scripts

jsdom's most powerful ability is that it can execute scripts inside the jsdom. These scripts can modify the content of the page and access all the web platform APIs jsdom implements.

However, this is also highly dangerous when dealing with untrusted content. The jsdom sandbox is not foolproof, and code running inside the DOM's `<script>`s can, if it tries hard enough, get access to the Node.js environment, and thus to your machine. As such, the ability to execute scripts embedded in the HTML is disabled by default:

```js
const dom = new JSDOM(`<body>
  <script>document.body.appendChild(document.createElement("hr"));</script>
</body>`);

// The script will not be executed, by default:
dom.window.document.body.children.length === 1;
```

To enable executing scripts inside the page, you can use the `runScripts: "dangerously"` option:

```js
const dom = new JSDOM(`<body>
  <script>document.body.appendChild(document.createElement("hr"));</script>
</body>`, { runScripts: "dangerously" });

// The script will be executed and modify the DOM:
dom.window.document.body.children.length === 2;
```

Again we emphasize to only use this when feeding jsdom code you know is safe. If you use it on arbitrary user-supplied code, or code from the Internet, you are effectively running untrusted Node.js code, and your machine could be compromised.

If you want to execute _external_ scripts, included via `<script src="">`, you'll also need to ensure that they load them. To do this, add the option `resources: "usable"` [as described below](#loading-subresources). (You'll likely also want to set the `url` option, for the reasons discussed there.)

Event handler attributes, like `<div onclick="">`, are also governed by this setting; they will not function unless `runScripts` is set to `"dangerously"`. (However, event handler _properties_, like `div.onclick = ...`, will function regardless of `runScripts`.)

If you are simply trying to execute script "from the outside", instead of letting `<script>` elements and event handlers attributes run "from the inside", you can use the `runScripts: "outside-only"` option, which enables fresh copies of all the JavaScript spec-provided globals to be installed on `window`. This includes things like `window.Array`, `window.Promise`, etc. It also, notably, includes `window.eval`, which allows running scripts, but with the jsdom `window` as the global:

```js
const { window } = new JSDOM(``, { runScripts: "outside-only" });

window.eval(`document.body.innerHTML = "<p>Hello, world!</p>";`);
window.document.body.children.length === 1;
```

This is turned off by default for performance reasons, but is safe to enable.

(Note that in the default configuration, without setting `runScripts`, the values of `window.Array`, `window.eval`, etc. will be the same as those provided by the outer Node.js environment. That is, `window.eval === eval` will hold, so `window.eval` will not run scripts in a useful way.)

We strongly advise against trying to "execute scripts" by mashing together the jsdom and Node global environments (e.g. by doing `global.window = dom.window`), and then executing scripts or test code inside the Node global environment. Instead, you should treat jsdom like you would a browser, and run all scripts and tests that need access to a DOM inside the jsdom environment, using `window.eval` or `runScripts: "dangerously"`. This might require, for example, creating a browserify bundle to execute as a `<script>` elementâjust like you would in a browser.

Finally, for advanced use cases you can use the `dom.getInternalVMContext()` method, documented below.

### Pretending to be a visual browser

jsdom does not have the capability to render visual content, and will act like a headless browser by default. It provides hints to web pages through APIs such as `document.hidden` that their content is not visible.

When the `pretendToBeVisual` option is set to `true`, jsdom will pretend that it is rendering and displaying content. It does this by:

* Changing `document.hidden` to return `false` instead of `true`
* Changing `document.visibilityState` to return `"visible"` instead of `"prerender"`
* Enabling `window.requestAnimationFrame()` and `window.cancelAnimationFrame()` methods, which otherwise do not exist

```js
const window = (new JSDOM(``, { pretendToBeVisual: true })).window;

window.requestAnimationFrame(timestamp => {
  console.log(timestamp > 0);
});
```

Note that jsdom still [does not do any layout or rendering](#unimplemented-parts-of-the-web-platform), so this is really just about _pretending_ to be visual, not about implementing the parts of the platform a real, visual web browser would implement.

### Loading subresources

#### Basic options

By default, jsdom will not load any subresources such as scripts, stylesheets, images, or iframes. If you'd like jsdom to load such resources, you can pass the `resources: "usable"` option, which will load all usable resources. Those are:

* Frames and iframes, via `<frame>` and `<iframe>`
* Stylesheets, via `<link rel="stylesheet">`
* Scripts, via `<script>`, but only if `runScripts: "dangerously"` is also set
* Images, via `<img>`, but only if the `canvas` npm package is also installed (see "[Canvas Support](#canvas-support)" below)

When attempting to load resources, recall that the default value for the `url` option is `"about:blank"`, which means that any resources included via relative URLs will fail to load. (The result of trying to parse the URL `/something` against the URL `about:blank` is an error.) So, you'll likely want to set a non-default value for the `url` option in those cases, or use one of the [convenience APIs](#convenience-apis) that do so automatically.

#### Advanced configuration

_This resource loader system is new as of jsdom v12.0.0, and we'd love your feedback on whether it meets your needs and how easy it is to use. Please file an issue to discuss!_

To more fully customize jsdom's resource-loading behavior, you can pass an instance of the `ResourceLoader` class as the `resources` option value:

```js
const resourceLoader = new jsdom.ResourceLoader({
  proxy: "http://127.0.0.1:9001",
  strictSSL: false,
  userAgent: "Mellblomenator/9000",
});
const dom = new JSDOM(``, { resources: resourceLoader });
```

The three options to the `ResourceLoader` constructor are:

- `proxy` is the address of an HTTP proxy to be used.
- `strictSSL` can be set to false to disable the requirement that SSL certificates be valid.
- `userAgent` affects the `User-Agent` header sent, and thus the resulting value for `navigator.userAgent`. It defaults to <code>\`Mozilla/5.0 (${process.platform || "unknown OS"}) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) jsdom/${jsdomVersion}\`</code>.

You can further customize resource fetching by subclassing `ResourceLoader` and overriding the `fetch()` method. For example, here is a version that only returns results for requests to a trusted origin:

```js
class CustomResourceLoader extends jsdom.ResourceLoader {
  fetch(url, options) {
    // Override the contents of this script to do something unusual.
    if (url === "https://example.com/some-specific-script.js") {
      return Promise.resolve(Buffer.from("window.someGlobal = 5;"));
    }

    return super.fetch(url, options);
  }
}
```

jsdom will call your custom resource loader's `fetch()` method whenever it encounters a "usable" resource, per the above section. The method takes a URL string, as well as a few options which you should pass through unmodified if calling `super.fetch()`. It must return a promise for a Node.js `Buffer` object, or return `null` if the resource is intentionally not to be loaded. In general, most cases will want to delegate to `super.fetch()`, as shown.

One of the options you will receive in `fetch()` will be the element (if applicable) that is fetching a resource.

```js
class CustomResourceLoader extends jsdom.ResourceLoader {
  fetch(url, options) {
    if (options.element) {
      console.log(`Element ${options.element.localName} is requesting the url ${url}`);
    }

    return super.fetch(url, options);
  }
}
```

### Virtual consoles

Like web browsers, jsdom has the concept of a "console". This records both information directly sent from the page, via scripts executing inside the document, as well as information from the jsdom implementation itself. We call the user-controllable console a "virtual console", to distinguish it from the Node.js `console` API and from the inside-the-page `window.console` API.

By default, the `JSDOM` constructor will return an instance with a virtual console that forwards all its output to the Node.js console. To create your own virtual console and pass it to jsdom, you can override this default by doing

```js
const virtualConsole = new jsdom.VirtualConsole();
const dom = new JSDOM(``, { virtualConsole });
```

Code like this will create a virtual console with no behavior. You can give it behavior by adding event listeners for all the possible console methods:

```js
virtualConsole.on("error", () => { ... });
virtualConsole.on("warn", () => { ... });
virtualConsole.on("info", () => { ... });
virtualConsole.on("dir", () => { ... });
// ... etc. See https://console.spec.whatwg.org/#logging
```

(Note that it is probably best to set up these event listeners *before* calling `new JSDOM()`, since errors or console-invoking script might occur during parsing.)

If you simply want to redirect the virtual console output to another console, like the default Node.js one, you can do

```js
virtualConsole.sendTo(console);
```

There is also a special event, `"jsdomError"`, which will fire with error objects to report errors from jsdom itself. This is similar to how error messages often show up in web browser consoles, even if they are not initiated by `console.error`. So far, the following errors are output this way:

- Errors loading or parsing subresources (scripts, stylesheets, frames, and iframes)
- Script execution errors that are not handled by a window `onerror` event handler that returns `true` or calls `event.preventDefault()`
- Not-implemented errors resulting from calls to methods, like `window.alert`, which jsdom does not implement, but installs anyway for web compatibility

If you're using `sendTo(c)` to send errors to `c`, by default it will call `c.error(errorStack[, errorDetail])` with information from `"jsdomError"` events. If you'd prefer to maintain a strict one-to-one mapping of events to method calls, and perhaps handle `"jsdomError"`s yourself, then you can do

```js
virtualConsole.sendTo(c, { omitJSDOMErrors: true });
```

### Cookie jars

Like web browsers, jsdom has the concept of a cookie jar, storing HTTP cookies. Cookies that have a URL on the same domain as the document, and are not marked HTTP-only, are accessible via the `document.cookie` API. Additionally, all cookies in the cookie jar will impact the fetching of subresources.

By default, the `JSDOM` constructor will return an instance with an empty cookie jar. To create your own cookie jar and pass it to jsdom, you can override this default by doing

```js
const cookieJar = new jsdom.CookieJar(store, options);
const dom = new JSDOM(``, { cookieJar });
```

This is mostly useful if you want to share the same cookie jar among multiple jsdoms, or prime the cookie jar with certain values ahead of time.

Cookie jars are provided by the [tough-cookie](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tough-cookie) package. The `jsdom.CookieJar` constructor is a subclass of the tough-cookie cookie jar which by default sets the `looseMode: true` option, since that [matches better how browsers behave](https://github.com/whatwg/html/issues/804). If you want to use tough-cookie's utilities and classes yourself, you can use the `jsdom.toughCookie` module export to get access to the tough-cookie module instance packaged with jsdom.

### Intervening before parsing

jsdom allows you to intervene in the creation of a jsdom very early: after the `Window` and `Document` objects are created, but before any HTML is parsed to populate the document with nodes:

```js
const dom = new JSDOM(`<p>Hello</p>`, {
  beforeParse(window) {
    window.document.childNodes.length === 0;
    window.someCoolAPI = () => { /* ... */ };
  }
});
```

This is especially useful if you are wanting to modify the environment in some way, for example adding shims for web platform APIs jsdom does not support.

## `JSDOM` object API

Once you have constructed a `JSDOM` object, it will have the following useful capabilities:

### Properties

The property `window` retrieves the `Window` object that was created for you.

The properties `virtualConsole` and `cookieJar` reflect the options you pass in, or the defaults created for you if nothing was passed in for those options.

### Serializing the document with `serialize()`

The `serialize()` method will return the [HTML serialization](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/#html-fragment-serialisation-algorithm) of the document, including the doctype:

```js
const dom = new JSDOM(`<!DOCTYPE html>hello`);

dom.serialize() === "<!DOCTYPE html><html><head></head><body>hello</body></html>";

// Contrast with:
dom.window.document.documentElement.outerHTML === "<html><head></head><body>hello</body></html>";
```

### Getting the source location of a node with `nodeLocation(node)`

The `nodeLocation()` method will find where a DOM node is within the source document, returning the [parse5 location info](https://www.npmjs.com/package/parse5#options-locationinfo) for the node:

```js
const dom = new JSDOM(
  `<p>Hello
    <img src="foo.jpg">
  </p>`,
  { includeNodeLocations: true }
);

const document = dom.window.document;
const bodyEl = document.body; // implicitly created
const pEl = document.querySelector("p");
const textNode = pEl.firstChild;
const imgEl = document.querySelector("img");

console.log(dom.nodeLocation(bodyEl));   // null; it's not in the source
console.log(dom.nodeLocation(pEl));      // { startOffset: 0, endOffset: 39, startTag: ..., endTag: ... }
console.log(dom.nodeLocation(textNode)); // { startOffset: 3, endOffset: 13 }
console.log(dom.nodeLocation(imgEl));    // { startOffset: 13, endOffset: 32 }
```

Note that this feature only works if you have set the `includeNodeLocations` option; node locations are off by default for performance reasons.

### Interfacing with the Node.js `vm` module using `getInternalVMContext()`

The built-in [`vm`](https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html) module of Node.js is what underpins jsdom's script-running magic. Some advanced use cases, like pre-compiling a script and then running it multiple times, benefit from using the `vm` module directly with a jsdom-created `Window`.

To get access to the [contextified global object](https://nodejs.org/api/vm.html#vm_what_does_it_mean_to_contextify_an_object), suitable for use with the `vm` APIs, you can use the `getInternalVMContext()` method:

```js
const { Script } = require("vm");

const dom = new JSDOM(``, { runScripts: "outside-only" });
const script = new Script(`
  if (!this.ran) {
    this.ran = 0;
  }

  ++this.ran;
`);

const vmContext = dom.getInternalVMContext();

script.runInContext(vmContext);
script.runInContext(vmContext);
script.runInContext(vmContext);

console.assert(dom.window.ran === 3);
```

This is somewhat-advanced functionality, and we advise sticking to normal DOM APIs (such as `window.eval()` or `document.createElement("script")`) unless you have very specific needs.

Note that this method will throw an exception if the `JSDOM` instance was created without `runScripts` set, or if you are [using jsdom in a web browser](#running-jsdom-inside-a-web-browser).

### Reconfiguring the jsdom with `reconfigure(settings)`

The `top` property on `window` is marked `[Unforgeable]` in the spec, meaning it is a non-configurable own property and thus cannot be overridden or shadowed by normal code running inside the jsdom, even using `Object.defineProperty`.

Similarly, at present jsdom does not handle navigation (such as setting `window.location.href = "https://example.com/"`); doing so will cause the virtual console to emit a `"jsdomError"` explaining that this feature is not implemented, and nothing will change: there will be no new `Window` or `Document` object, and the existing `window`'s `location` object will still have all the same property values.

However, if you're acting from outside the window, e.g. in some test framework that creates jsdoms, you can override one or both of these using the special `reconfigure()` method:

```js
const dom = new JSDOM();

dom.window.top === dom.window;
dom.window.location.href === "about:blank";

dom.reconfigure({ windowTop: myFakeTopForTesting, url: "https://example.com/" });

dom.window.top === myFakeTopForTesting;
dom.window.location.href === "https://example.com/";
```

Note that changing the jsdom's URL will impact all APIs that return the current document URL, such as `window.location`, `document.URL`, and `document.documentURI`, as well as the resolution of relative URLs within the document, and the same-origin checks and referrer used while fetching subresources. It will not, however, perform navigation to the contents of that URL; the contents of the DOM will remain unchanged, and no new instances of `Window`, `Document`, etc. will be created.

## Convenience APIs

### `fromURL()`

In addition to the `JSDOM` constructor itself, jsdom provides a promise-returning factory method for constructing a jsdom from a URL:

```js
JSDOM.fromURL("https://example.com/", options).then(dom => {
  console.log(dom.serialize());
});
```

The returned promise will fulfill with a `JSDOM` instance if the URL is valid and the request is successful. Any redirects will be followed to their ultimate destination.

The options provided to `fromURL()` are similar to those provided to the `JSDOM` constructor, with the following additional restrictions and consequences:

- The `url` and `contentType` options cannot be provided.
- The `referrer` option is used as the HTTP `Referer` request header of the initial request.
- The `resources` option also affects the initial request; this is useful if you want to, for example, configure a proxy (see above).
- The resulting jsdom's URL, content type, and referrer are determined from the response.
- Any cookies set via HTTP `Set-Cookie` response headers are stored in the jsdom's cookie jar. Similarly, any cookies already in a supplied cookie jar are sent as HTTP `Cookie` request headers.

### `fromFile()`

Similar to `fromURL()`, jsdom also provides a `fromFile()` factory method for constructing a jsdom from a filename:

```js
JSDOM.fromFile("stuff.html", options).then(dom => {
  console.log(dom.serialize());
});
```

The returned promise will fulfill with a `JSDOM` instance if the given file can be opened. As usual in Node.js APIs, the filename is given relative to the current working directory.

The options provided to `fromFile()` are similar to those provided to the `JSDOM` constructor, with the following additional defaults:

- The `url` option will default to a file URL corresponding to the given filename, instead of to `"about:blank"`.
- The `contentType` option will default to `"application/xhtml+xml"` if the given filename ends in `.xht`, `.xhtml`, or `.xml`; otherwise it will continue to default to `"text/html"`.

### `fragment()`

For the very simplest of cases, you might not need a whole `JSDOM` instance with all its associated power. You might not even need a `Window` or `Document`! Instead, you just need to parse some HTML, and get a DOM object you can manipulate. For that, we have `fragment()`, which creates a `DocumentFragment` from a given string:

```js
const frag = JSDOM.fragment(`<p>Hello</p><p><strong>Hi!</strong>`);

frag.childNodes.length === 2;
frag.querySelector("strong").textContent === "Hi!";
// etc.
```

Here `frag` is a [`DocumentFragment`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/DocumentFragment) instance, whose contents are created by parsing the provided string. The parsing is done using a `<template>` element, so you can include any element there (including ones with weird parsing rules like `<td>`). It's also important to note that the resulting `DocumentFragment` will not have [an associated browsing context](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/#concept-document-bc): that is, elements' `ownerDocument` will have a null `defaultView` property, resources will not load, etc.

All invocations of the `fragment()` factory result in `DocumentFragment`s that share the same template owner `Document`. This allows many calls to `fragment()` with no extra overhead. But it also means that calls to `fragment()` cannot be customized with any options.

Note that serialization is not as easy with `DocumentFragment`s as it is with full `JSDOM` objects. If you need to serialize your DOM, you should probably use the `JSDOM` constructor more directly. But for the special case of a fragment containing a single element, it's pretty easy to do through normal means:

```js
const frag = JSDOM.fragment(`<p>Hello</p>`);
console.log(frag.firstChild.outerHTML); // logs "<p>Hello</p>"
```

## Other noteworthy features

### Canvas support

jsdom includes support for using the [`canvas`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas) package to extend any `<canvas>` elements with the canvas API. To make this work, you need to include `canvas` as a dependency in your project, as a peer of `jsdom`. If jsdom can find the `canvas` package, it will use it, but if it's not present, then `<canvas>` elements will behave like `<div>`s. Since jsdom v13, version 2.x of `canvas` is required; version 1.x is no longer supported.

### Encoding sniffing

In addition to supplying a string, the `JSDOM` constructor can also be supplied binary data, in the form of a Node.js [`Buffer`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/buffer.html) or a standard JavaScript binary data type like `ArrayBuffer`, `Uint8Array`, `DataView`, etc. When this is done, jsdom will [sniff the encoding](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/syntax.html#encoding-sniffing-algorithm) from the supplied bytes, scanning for `<meta charset>` tags just like a browser does.

If the supplied `contentType` option contains a `charset` parameter, that encoding will override the sniffed encodingâunless a UTF-8 or UTF-16 BOM is present, in which case those take precedence. (Again, this is just like a browser.)

This encoding sniffing also applies to `JSDOM.fromFile()` and `JSDOM.fromURL()`. In the latter case, any `Content-Type` headers sent with the response will take priority, in the same fashion as the constructor's `contentType` option.

Note that in many cases supplying bytes in this fashion can be better than supplying a string. For example, if you attempt to use Node.js's `buffer.toString("utf-8")` API, Node.js will not strip any leading BOMs. If you then give this string to jsdom, it will interpret it verbatim, leaving the BOM intact. But jsdom's binary data decoding code will strip leading BOMs, just like a browser; in such cases, supplying `buffer` directly will give the desired result.

### Closing down a jsdom

Timers in the jsdom (set by `window.setTimeout()` or `window.setInterval()`) will, by definition, execute code in the future in the context of the window. Since there is no way to execute code in the future without keeping the process alive, outstanding jsdom timers will keep your Node.js process alive. Similarly, since there is no way to execute code in the context of an object without keeping that object alive, outstanding jsdom timers will prevent garbage collection of the window on which they are scheduled.

If you want to be sure to shut down a jsdom window, use `window.close()`, which will terminate all running timers (and also remove any event listeners on the window and document).

### Running jsdom inside a web browser

jsdom has some support for being run inside a web browser, using [browserify](https://browserify.org/). That is, inside a web browser, you can use a browserified jsdom to create an entirely self-contained set of plain JavaScript objects which look and act much like the browser's existing DOM objects, while being entirely independent of them. "Virtual DOM", indeed!

jsdom's primary target is still Node.js, and so we use language features that are only present in recent Node.js versions (namely, Node.js v8+). Thus, older browsers will likely not work. (Even transpilation will not help: we use `Proxy`s extensively throughout the jsdom codebase.)

Notably, jsdom works well inside a web worker. The original contributor, [@lawnsea](https://github.com/lawnsea/), who made this possible, has [published a paper](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/47f0/6bb6607a975500a30e9e52d7c9fbc0034e27.pdf) about his project which uses this capability.

Not everything works perfectly when running jsdom inside a web browser. Sometimes that is because of fundamental limitations (such as not having filesystem access), but sometimes it is simply because we haven't spent enough time making the appropriate small tweaks. Bug reports are certainly welcome.

### Debugging the DOM using Chrome Devtools

As of Node.js v6 you can debug programs using Chrome Devtools. See the [official documentation](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/inspector/) for how to get started.

By default jsdom elements are formatted as plain old JS objects in the console. To make it easier to debug, you can use [jsdom-devtools-formatter](https://github.com/viddo/jsdom-devtools-formatter), which lets you inspect them like real DOM elements.

## Caveats

### Asynchronous script loading

People often have trouble with asynchronous script loading when using jsdom. Many pages load scripts asynchronously, but there is no way to tell when they're done doing so, and thus when it's a good time to run your code and inspect the resulting DOM structure. This is a fundamental limitation; we cannot predict what scripts on the web page will do, and so cannot tell you when they are done loading more scripts.

This can be worked around in a few ways. The best way, if you control the page in question, is to use whatever mechanisms are given by the script loader to detect when loading is done. For example, if you're using a module loader like RequireJS, the code could look like:

```js
// On the Node.js side:
const window = (new JSDOM(...)).window;
window.onModulesLoaded = () => {
  console.log("ready to roll!");
};
```

```html
<!-- Inside the HTML you supply to jsdom -->
<script>
requirejs(["entry-module"], () => {
  window.onModulesLoaded();
});
</script>
```

If you do not control the page, you could try workarounds such as polling for the presence of a specific element.

### Unimplemented parts of the web platform

Although we enjoy adding new features to jsdom and keeping it up to date with the latest web specs, it has many missing APIs. Please feel free to file an issue for anything missing, but we're a small and busy team, so a pull request might work even better.

Beyond just features that we haven't gotten to yet, there are two major features that are currently outside the scope of jsdom. These are:

- **Navigation**: the ability to change the global object, and all other objects, when clicking a link or assigning `location.href` or similar.
- **Layout**: the ability to calculate where elements will be visually laid out as a result of CSS, which impacts methods like `getBoundingClientRects()` or properties like `offsetTop`.

Currently jsdom has dummy behaviors for some aspects of these features, such as sending a "not implemented" `"jsdomError"` to the virtual console for navigation, or returning zeros for many layout-related properties. Often you can work around these limitations in your code, e.g. by creating new `JSDOM` instances for each page you "navigate" to during a crawl, or using `Object.defineProperty()` to change what various layout-related getters and methods return.

Note that other tools in the same space, such as PhantomJS, do support these features. On the wiki, we have a more complete writeup about [jsdom vs. PhantomJS](https://github.com/jsdom/jsdom/wiki/jsdom-vs.-PhantomJS).

Basic HTTP cookie parser and serializer for HTTP servers.

## Installation

This is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) module available through the
[npm registry](https://www.npmjs.com/). Installation is done using the
[`npm install` command](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-locally):

```sh
$ npm install cookie
```

## API

```js
var cookie = require('cookie');
```

### cookie.parse(str, options)

Parse an HTTP `Cookie` header string and returning an object of all cookie name-value pairs.
The `str` argument is the string representing a `Cookie` header value and `options` is an
optional object containing additional parsing options.

```js
var cookies = cookie.parse('foo=bar; equation=E%3Dmc%5E2');
// { foo: 'bar', equation: 'E=mc^2' }
```

#### Options

`cookie.parse` accepts these properties in the options object.

##### decode

Specifies a function that will be used to decode a cookie's value. Since the value of a cookie
has a limited character set (and must be a simple string), this function can be used to decode
a previously-encoded cookie value into a JavaScript string or other object.

The default function is the global `decodeURIComponent`, which will decode any URL-encoded
sequences into their byte representations.

**note** if an error is thrown from this function, the original, non-decoded cookie value will
be returned as the cookie's value.

### cookie.serialize(name, value, options)

Serialize a cookie name-value pair into a `Set-Cookie` header string. The `name` argument is the
name for the cookie, the `value` argument is the value to set the cookie to, and the `options`
argument is an optional object containing additional serialization options.

```js
var setCookie = cookie.serialize('foo', 'bar');
// foo=bar
```

#### Options

`cookie.serialize` accepts these properties in the options object.

##### domain

Specifies the value for the [`Domain` `Set-Cookie` attribute][rfc-6265-5.2.3]. By default, no
domain is set, and most clients will consider the cookie to apply to only the current domain.

##### encode

Specifies a function that will be used to encode a cookie's value. Since value of a cookie
has a limited character set (and must be a simple string), this function can be used to encode
a value into a string suited for a cookie's value.

The default function is the global `encodeURIComponent`, which will encode a JavaScript string
into UTF-8 byte sequences and then URL-encode any that fall outside of the cookie range.

##### expires

Specifies the `Date` object to be the value for the [`Expires` `Set-Cookie` attribute][rfc-6265-5.2.1].
By default, no expiration is set, and most clients will consider this a "non-persistent cookie" and
will delete it on a condition like exiting a web browser application.

**note** the [cookie storage model specification][rfc-6265-5.3] states that if both `expires` and
`maxAge` are set, then `maxAge` takes precedence, but it is possible not all clients by obey this,
so if both are set, they should point to the same date and time.

##### httpOnly

Specifies the `boolean` value for the [`HttpOnly` `Set-Cookie` attribute][rfc-6265-5.2.6]. When truthy,
the `HttpOnly` attribute is set, otherwise it is not. By default, the `HttpOnly` attribute is not set.

**note** be careful when setting this to `true`, as compliant clients will not allow client-side
JavaScript to see the cookie in `document.cookie`.

##### maxAge

Specifies the `number` (in seconds) to be the value for the [`Max-Age` `Set-Cookie` attribute][rfc-6265-5.2.2].
The given number will be converted to an integer by rounding down. By default, no maximum age is set.

**note** the [cookie storage model specification][rfc-6265-5.3] states that if both `expires` and
`maxAge` are set, then `maxAge` takes precedence, but it is possible not all clients by obey this,
so if both are set, they should point to the same date and time.

##### path

Specifies the value for the [`Path` `Set-Cookie` attribute][rfc-6265-5.2.4]. By default, the path
is considered the ["default path"][rfc-6265-5.1.4].

##### priority

Specifies the `string` to be the value for the [`Priority` `Set-Cookie` attribute][rfc-west-cookie-priority-00-4.1].

  - `'low'` will set the `Priority` attribute to `Low`.
  - `'medium'` will set the `Priority` attribute to `Medium`, the default priority when not set.
  - `'high'` will set the `Priority` attribute to `High`.

More information about the different priority levels can be found in
[the specification][rfc-west-cookie-priority-00-4.1].

**note** This is an attribute that has not yet been fully standardized, and may change in the future.
This also means many clients may ignore this attribute until they understand it.

##### sameSite

Specifies the `boolean` or `string` to be the value for the [`SameSite` `Set-Cookie` attribute][rfc-6265bis-09-5.4.7].

  - `true` will set the `SameSite` attribute to `Strict` for strict same site enforcement.
  - `false` will not set the `SameSite` attribute.
  - `'lax'` will set the `SameSite` attribute to `Lax` for lax same site enforcement.
  - `'none'` will set the `SameSite` attribute to `None` for an explicit cross-site cookie.
  - `'strict'` will set the `SameSite` attribute to `Strict` for strict same site enforcement.

More information about the different enforcement levels can be found in
[the specification][rfc-6265bis-09-5.4.7].

**note** This is an attribute that has not yet been fully standardized, and may change in the future.
This also means many clients may ignore this attribute until they understand it.

##### secure

Specifies the `boolean` value for the [`Secure` `Set-Cookie` attribute][rfc-6265-5.2.5]. When truthy,
the `Secure` attribute is set, otherwise it is not. By default, the `Secure` attribute is not set.

**note** be careful when setting this to `true`, as compliant clients will not send the cookie back to
the server in the future if the browser does not have an HTTPS connection.

## Example

The following example uses this module in conjunction with the Node.js core HTTP server
to prompt a user for their name and display it back on future visits.

```js
var cookie = require('cookie');
var escapeHtml = require('escape-html');
var http = require('http');
var url = require('url');

function onRequest(req, res) {
  // Parse the query string
  var query = url.parse(req.url, true, true).query;

  if (query && query.name) {
    // Set a new cookie with the name
    res.setHeader('Set-Cookie', cookie.serialize('name', String(query.name), {
      httpOnly: true,
      maxAge: 60 * 60 * 24 * 7 // 1 week
    }));

    // Redirect back after setting cookie
    res.statusCode = 302;
    res.setHeader('Location', req.headers.referer || '/');
    res.end();
    return;
  }

  // Parse the cookies on the request
  var cookies = cookie.parse(req.headers.cookie || '');

  // Get the visitor name set in the cookie
  var name = cookies.name;

  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/html; charset=UTF-8');

  if (name) {
    res.write('<p>Welcome back, <b>' + escapeHtml(name) + '</b>!</p>');
  } else {
    res.write('<p>Hello, new visitor!</p>');
  }

  res.write('<form method="GET">');
  res.write('<input placeholder="enter your name" name="name"> <input type="submit" value="Set Name">');
  res.end('</form>');
}

http.createServer(onRequest).listen(3000);
```

# merge-stream

Merge (interleave) a bunch of streams.

[![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/grncdr/merge-stream.svg?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/grncdr/merge-stream)

## Synopsis

```javascript
var stream1 = new Stream();
var stream2 = new Stream();

var merged = mergeStream(stream1, stream2);

var stream3 = new Stream();
merged.add(stream3);
merged.isEmpty();
//=> false
```

## Description

This is adapted from [event-stream](https://github.com/dominictarr/event-stream) separated into a new module, using Streams3.

## API

### `mergeStream`

Type: `function`

Merges an arbitrary number of streams. Returns a merged stream.

#### `merged.add`

A method to dynamically add more sources to the stream. The argument supplied to `add` can be either a source or an array of sources.

#### `merged.isEmpty`

A method that tells you if the merged stream is empty.

When a stream is "empty" (aka. no sources were added), it could not be returned to a gulp task.

So, we could do something like this:

```js
stream = require('merge-stream')();
// Something like a loop to add some streams to the merge stream
// stream.add(streamA);
// stream.add(streamB);
return stream.isEmpty() ? null : stream;
```

## Gulp example

An example use case for **merge-stream** is to combine parts of a task in a project's **gulpfile.js** like this:

```js
const gulp =          require('gulp');
const htmlValidator = require('gulp-w3c-html-validator');
const jsHint =        require('gulp-jshint');
const mergeStream =   require('merge-stream');

function lint() {
  return mergeStream(
    gulp.src('src/*.html')
      .pipe(htmlValidator())
      .pipe(htmlValidator.reporter()),
    gulp.src('src/*.js')
      .pipe(jsHint())
      .pipe(jsHint.reporter())
  );
}
gulp.task('lint', lint);
```

It works on\nat rules, normal rules and declarations. Note that this module does not have any\nresponsibility for normalising declarations, selectors or whitespace, so that it\nconsiders these two rules to be different:\n\n```css\nh1, h2 {\n    color: blue;\n}\n\nh2, h1 {\n    color: blue;\n}\n```\n\nIt has to assume that your rules have already been transformed by another\nprocessor, otherwise it would be responsible for too many things.\n\n### Input\n\n```css\nh1 {\n    margin: 0 auto;\n    margin: 0 auto\n}\n\nh1 {\n    margin: 0 auto\n}\n```\n\n### Output\n\n```css\nh1 {\n    margin: 0 auto\n}\n```\n\n## Usage\n\nSee the [PostCSS documentation](https://github.com/postcss/postcss#usage) for\nexamples for your environment.\n\n\n## Contributors\n\nSee [CONTRIBUTORS.md](https://github.com/cssnano/cssnano/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md).\n\n\n## License\n\nMIT Â© [Ben Briggs](http://beneb.info)\n\n\n[postcss]: https://github.com/postcss/postcss\n"

[![Build Status][build-badge]][build]
[![version][version-badge]][package]
[![MIT License][license-badge]][license]

Node API of SVGR.

```
npm install @svgr/core
```

## Usage

```js
import svgr from '@svgr/core'

const svgCode = `
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"
  xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
  <rect x="10" y="10" height="100" width="100"
    style="stroke:#ff0000; fill: #0000ff"/>
</svg>
`

svgr(svgCode, { icon: true }, { componentName: 'MyComponent' }).then(
  (jsCode) => {
    console.log(jsCode)
  },
)
```

Use `svgr.sync(code, config, state)` if you would like to use sync version.

### Plugins

By default `@svgr/core` doesn't include `svgo` and `prettier` plugins, if you want them, you have to install them and include them in config.

```js
svgr(svgCode, {
  plugins: ['@svgr/plugin-svgo', '@svgr/plugin-jsx', '@svgr/plugin-prettier'],
}).then((jsCode) => {
  console.log(jsCode)
})
```

# @jridgewell/gen-mapping

> Generate source maps

`gen-mapping` allows you to generate a source map during transpilation or minification.
With a source map, you're able to trace the original location in the source file, either in Chrome's
DevTools or using a library like [`@jridgewell/trace-mapping`][trace-mapping].

You may already be familiar with the [`source-map`][source-map] package's `SourceMapGenerator`. This
provides the same `addMapping` and `setSourceContent` API.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @jridgewell/gen-mapping
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { GenMapping, addMapping, setSourceContent, encodedMap } from '@jridgewell/gen-mapping';

const map = new GenMapping({
  file: 'output.js',
  sourceRoot: 'https://example.com/',
});

setSourceContent(map, 'input.js', `function foo() {}`);

addMapping(map, {
  // Lines start at line 1, columns at column 0.
  generated: { line: 1, column: 0 },
  source: 'input.js',
  original: { line: 1, column: 0 },
});

addMapping(map, {
  generated: { line: 1, column: 9 },
  source: 'input.js',
  original: { line: 1, column: 9 },
  name: 'foo',
});

assert.deepEqual(encodedMap(map), {
  version: 3,
  file: 'output.js',
  names: ['foo'],
  sourceRoot: 'https://example.com/',
  sources: ['input.js'],
  sourcesContent: ['function foo() {}'],
  mappings: 'AAAA,SAASA',
});
```

# globby

> User-friendly glob matching

Based on [`fast-glob`](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob) but adds a bunch of useful features.

## Features

- Promise API
- Multiple patterns
- Negated patterns: `['foo*', '!foobar']`
- Expands directories: `foo` â `foo/**/*`
- Supports `.gitignore`

## Install

```
$ npm install globby
```

## Usage

```
âââ unicorn
âââ cake
âââ rainbow
```

```js
const globby = require('globby');

(async () => {
	const paths = await globby(['*', '!cake']);

	console.log(paths);
	//=> ['unicorn', 'rainbow']
})();
```

## API

Note that glob patterns can only contain forward-slashes, not backward-slashes, so if you want to construct a glob pattern from path components, you need to use `path.posix.join()` instead of `path.join()`.

### globby(patterns, options?)

Returns a `Promise<string[]>` of matching paths.

#### patterns

Type: `string | string[]`

See supported `minimatch` [patterns](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch#usage).

#### options

Type: `object`

See the [`fast-glob` options](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob#options-3) in addition to the ones below.

##### expandDirectories

Type: `boolean | string[] | object`\
Default: `true`

If set to `true`, `globby` will automatically glob directories for you. If you define an `Array` it will only glob files that matches the patterns inside the `Array`. You can also define an `object` with `files` and `extensions` like below:

```js
const globby = require('globby');

(async () => {
	const paths = await globby('images', {
		expandDirectories: {
			files: ['cat', 'unicorn', '*.jpg'],
			extensions: ['png']
		}
	});

	console.log(paths);
	//=> ['cat.png', 'unicorn.png', 'cow.jpg', 'rainbow.jpg']
})();
```

Note that if you set this option to `false`, you won't get back matched directories unless you set `onlyFiles: false`.

##### gitignore

Type: `boolean`\
Default: `false`

Respect ignore patterns in `.gitignore` files that apply to the globbed files.

### globby.sync(patterns, options?)

Returns `string[]` of matching paths.

### globby.stream(patterns, options?)

Returns a [`stream.Readable`](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_streams) of matching paths.

Since Node.js 10, [readable streams are iterable](https://nodejs.org/api/stream.html#stream_readable_symbol_asynciterator), so you can loop over glob matches in a [`for await...of` loop](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of) like this:

```js
const globby = require('globby');

(async () => {
	for await (const path of globby.stream('*.tmp')) {
		console.log(path);
	}
})();
```

### globby.generateGlobTasks(patterns, options?)

Returns an `object[]` in the format `{pattern: string, options: Object}`, which can be passed as arguments to [`fast-glob`](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob). This is useful for other globbing-related packages.

Note that you should avoid running the same tasks multiple times as they contain a file system cache. Instead, run this method each time to ensure file system changes are taken into consideration.

### globby.hasMagic(patterns, options?)

Returns a `boolean` of whether there are any special glob characters in the `patterns`.

Note that the options affect the results.

This function is backed by [`fast-glob`](https://github.com/mrmlnc/fast-glob#isdynamicpatternpattern-options).

### globby.gitignore(options?)

Returns a `Promise<(path: string) => boolean>` indicating whether a given path is ignored via a `.gitignore` file.

Takes `cwd?: string` and `ignore?: string[]` as options. `.gitignore` files matched by the ignore config are not used for the resulting filter function.

```js
const {gitignore} = require('globby');

(async () => {
	const isIgnored = await gitignore();
	console.log(isIgnored('some/file'));
})();
```

### globby.gitignore.sync(options?)

Returns a `(path: string) => boolean` indicating whether a given path is ignored via a `.gitignore` file.

Takes the same options as `globby.gitignore`.

## Globbing patterns

Just a quick overview.

- `*` matches any number of characters, but not `/`
- `?` matches a single character, but not `/`
- `**` matches any number of characters, including `/`, as long as it's the only thing in a path part
- `{}` allows for a comma-separated list of "or" expressions
- `!` at the beginning of a pattern will negate the match

[PostCSS Pseudo Class Any Link] lets you `:any-link` pseudo-class in CSS,
following the [Selectors] specification.

```pcss
nav :any-link > span {
  background-color: yellow;
}

/* becomes */

nav :link > span, nav :visited > span {
  background-color: yellow;
}

nav :any-link > span {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

From the [proposal][Selectors]:

> The `:any-link` pseudo-class represents an element that acts as the source
  anchor of a hyperlink. It matches an element if the element would match
  `:link` or `:visited`.

[!['Can I use' table](https://caniuse.bitsofco.de/image/css-any-link.png)](https://caniuse.com/#feat=css-any-link)

## Usage

Add [PostCSS Pseudo Class Any Link] to your project:

```bash
npm install postcss postcss-pseudo-class-any-link --save-dev
```

Use [PostCSS Pseudo Class Any Link] as a [PostCSS] plugin:

```js
const postcss = require('postcss');
const postcssPseudoClassAnyLink = require('postcss-pseudo-class-any-link');

postcss([
  postcssPseudoClassAnyLink(/* pluginOptions */)
]).process(YOUR_CSS /*, processOptions */);
```

[PostCSS Pseudo Class Any Link] runs in all Node environments, with special
instructions for:

| [Node](INSTALL.md#node) | [PostCSS CLI](INSTALL.md#postcss-cli) | [Webpack](INSTALL.md#webpack) | [Create React App](INSTALL.md#create-react-app) | [Gulp](INSTALL.md#gulp) | [Grunt](INSTALL.md#grunt) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Options

### preserve

The `preserve` option determines whether the original `:any-link` rule is
preserved. By default, it is preserved.

```js
postcssPseudoClassAnyLink({ preserve: false })
```

```pcss
nav :any-link > span {
  background-color: yellow;
}

/* becomes */

nav :link > span, nav :visited > span {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

The `subFeatures.areaHrefNeedsFixing` option determines if `<area href>` elements should match `:any-link` pseudo-class.<br>
In IE and Edge these do not match `:link` or `:visited`.

_This increased CSS bundle size and is disabled by default._

```js
postcssPseudoClassAnyLink({
  subFeatures: {
    areaHrefNeedsFixing: true
  }
})
```

```pcss
nav :any-link > span {
  background-color: yellow;
}

/* becomes */

nav :link > span, nav :visited > span, area[href] > span {
  background-color: yellow;
}
```

Fixes an issue with v6.2.6 when using `babel-loader` as a global package.

## v6.2.6

### ð Bug Fix

- Use standard cache dir as default `cacheDirectory` (#301) @fson

Use the common cache directory, `./node_modules/.cache/babel-loader`, as the default cache directory (when the cacheDirectory setting is enabled).

```js
query: {
  cacheDirectory: true
}
```

## v6.2.5

- Don't show the call stack for a Babel error (such as when you have a syntax error)

<img width="415" alt="screenshot 2016-08-15 15 24 37" src="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/30594/17664401/727ba098-62fc-11e6-9f12-42da0cf47f14.png">

html-entities
=============

Fastest HTML entities library.

Comes with both TypeScript and Flow types.

Installation
------------

```bash
$ npm install html-entities
```

Usage
-----

### encode(text, options)

Encodes text replacing HTML special characters (`<>&"'`) plus other character ranges depending on `mode` option value.

```js
import {encode} from 'html-entities';

encode('< > " \' & Â© â');
// -> '&lt; &gt; &quot; &apos; &amp; Â© â'

encode('< Â©', {mode: 'nonAsciiPrintable'});
// -> '&lt; &copy;'

encode('< Â©', {mode: 'nonAsciiPrintable', level: 'xml'});
// -> '&lt; &#169;'
```

Options:

#### level

 * `all` alias to `html5` (default).
 * `html5` uses `HTML5` named references.
 * `html4` uses `HTML4` named references.
 * `xml` uses `XML` named references.

#### mode

 * `specialChars` encodes only HTML special characters (default).
 * `nonAscii` encodes HTML special characters and everything outside of the [ASCII character range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII).
 * `nonAsciiPrintable` encodes HTML special characters and everything outiside of the [ASCII printable characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).
 * `extensive` encodes all non-printable characters, non-ASCII characters and all characters with named references.

#### numeric

 * `decimal` uses decimal numbers when encoding html entities. i.e. `&#169;` (default).
 * `hexadecimal` uses hexadecimal numbers when encoding html entities. i.e. `&#xa9;`.


### decode(text, options)

Decodes text replacing entities to characters. Unknown entities are left as is.

```js
import {decode} from 'html-entities';

decode('&lt; &gt; &quot; &apos; &amp; &#169; &#8710;');
// -> '< > " \' & Â© â'

decode('&copy;', {level: 'html5'});
// -> 'Â©'

decode('&copy;', {level: 'xml'});
// -> '&copy;'
```

Options:

#### level

 * `all` alias to `html5` (default).
 * `html5` uses `HTML5` named references.
 * `html4` uses `HTML4` named references.
 * `xml` uses `XML` named references.

#### scope

 * `body` emulates behavior of browser when parsing tag bodies: entities without semicolon are also replaced (default).
 * `attribute` emulates behavior of browser when parsing tag attributes: entities without semicolon are replaced when not followed by equality sign `=`.
 * `strict` ignores entities without semicolon.

### decodeEntity(text, options)

Decodes a single HTML entity. Unknown entitiy is left as is.

```js
import {decodeEntity} from 'html-entities';

decodeEntity('&lt;');
// -> '<'

decodeEntity('&copy;', {level: 'html5'});
// -> 'Â©'

decodeEntity('&copy;', {level: 'xml'});
// -> '&copy;'
```

Options:

#### level

 * `all` alias to `html5` (default).
 * `html5` uses `HTML5` named references.
 * `html4` uses `HTML4` named references.
 * `xml` uses `XML` named references.

# globals

> Global identifiers from different JavaScript environments

It's just a [JSON file](globals.json), so use it in any environment.

This package is used by ESLint.

**This package [no longer accepts](https://github.com/sindresorhus/globals/issues/82) new environments. If you need it for ESLint, just [create a plugin](http://eslint.org/docs/developer-guide/working-with-plugins#environments-in-plugins).**

## Install

```
$ npm install globals
```

## Usage

```js
const globals = require('globals');

console.log(globals.browser);
/*
{
	addEventListener: false,
	applicationCache: false,
	ArrayBuffer: false,
	atob: false,
	â¦
}
*/
```

Each global is given a value of `true` or `false`. A value of `true` indicates that the variable may be overwritten. A value of `false` indicates that the variable should be considered read-only. This information is used by static analysis tools to flag incorrect behavior. We assume all variables should be `false` unless we hear otherwise.

For Node.js this package provides two sets of globals:

- `globals.nodeBuiltin`: Globals available to all code running in Node.js.
	These will usually be available as properties on the `global` object and include `process`, `Buffer`, but not CommonJS arguments like `require`.
	See: https://nodejs.org/api/globals.html
- `globals.node`: A combination of the globals from `nodeBuiltin` plus all CommonJS arguments ("CommonJS module scope").
	See: https://nodejs.org/api/modules.html#modules_the_module_scope

When analyzing code that is known to run outside of a CommonJS wrapper, for example, JavaScript modules, `nodeBuiltin` can find accidental CommonJS references.

# @jridgewell/source-map

> Packages `@jridgewell/trace-mapping` and `@jridgewell/gen-mapping` into the familiar source-map API

This isn't the full API, but it's the core functionality. This wraps
[@jridgewell/trace-mapping][trace-mapping] and [@jridgewell/gen-mapping][gen-mapping]
implementations.

## Installation

```sh
npm install @jridgewell/source-map
```

## Usage

TODO

### SourceMapConsumer

```typescript
import { SourceMapConsumer } from '@jridgewell/source-map';
const smc = new SourceMapConsumer({
  version: 3,
  names: ['foo'],
  sources: ['input.js'],
  mappings: 'AAAAA',
});
```

#### SourceMapConsumer.prototype.originalPositionFor(generatedPosition)

```typescript
const smc = new SourceMapConsumer(map);
smc.originalPositionFor({ line: 1, column: 0 });
```

### SourceMapGenerator

```typescript
import { SourceMapGenerator } from '@jridgewell/source-map';
const smg = new SourceMapGenerator({
  file: 'output.js',
  sourceRoot: 'https://example.com/',
});
```

#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.addMapping(mapping)

```typescript
const smg = new SourceMapGenerator();
smg.addMapping({
  generated: { line: 1, column: 0 },
  source: 'input.js',
  original: { line: 1, column: 0 },
  name: 'foo',
});
```

#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.setSourceContent(sourceFile, sourceContent)

```typescript
const smg = new SourceMapGenerator();
smg.setSourceContent('input.js', 'foobar');
```

#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.toJSON()

```typescript
const smg = new SourceMapGenerator();
smg.toJSON(); // { version: 3, names: [], sources: [], mappings: '' }
```

#### SourceMapGenerator.prototype.toDecodedMap()

```typescript
const smg = new SourceMapGenerator();
smg.toDecodedMap(); // { version: 3, names: [], sources: [], mappings: [] }
```

### Version 4.0.0 (2018-01-28) ###

- Added: Support for ES2018. The only change needed was recognizing the `s`
  regex flag.
- Changed: _All_ tokens returned by the `matchToToken` function now have a
  `closed` property. It is set to `undefined` for the tokens where âclosedâ
  doesnât make sense. This means that all tokens objects have the same shape,
  which might improve performance.

These are the breaking changes:

- `'/a/s'.match(jsTokens)` no longer returns `['/', 'a', '/', 's']`, but
  `['/a/s']`. (There are of course other variations of this.)
- Code that rely on some token objects not having the `closed` property could
  now behave differently.


### Version 3.0.2 (2017-06-28) ###

- No code changes. Just updates to the readme.


### Version 3.0.1 (2017-01-30) ###

- Fixed: ES2015 unicode escapes with more than 6 hex digits are now matched
  correctly.


### Version 3.0.0 (2017-01-11) ###

This release contains one breaking change, that should [improve performance in
V8][v8-perf]:

> So how can you, as a JavaScript developer, ensure that your RegExps are fast?
> If you are not interested in hooking into RegExp internals, make sure that
> neither the RegExp instance, nor its prototype is modified in order to get the
> best performance:
>
> ```js
> var re = /./g;
> re.exec('');  // Fast path.
> re.new_property = 'slow';
> ```

This module used to export a single regex, with `.matchToToken` bolted
on, just like in the above example. This release changes the exports of
the module to avoid this issue.

Before:

```js
import jsTokens from "js-tokens"
// or:
var jsTokens = require("js-tokens")
var matchToToken = jsTokens.matchToToken
```

After:

```js
import jsTokens, {matchToToken} from "js-tokens"
// or:
var jsTokens = require("js-tokens").default
var matchToToken = require("js-tokens").matchToToken
```

[v8-perf]: http://v8project.blogspot.se/2017/01/speeding-up-v8-regular-expressions.html


### Version 2.0.0 (2016-06-19) ###

- Added: Support for ES2016. In other words, support for the `**` exponentiation
  operator.

These are the breaking changes:

- `'**'.match(jsTokens)` no longer returns `['*', '*']`, but `['**']`.
- `'**='.match(jsTokens)` no longer returns `['*', '*=']`, but `['**=']`.


### Version 1.0.3 (2016-03-27) ###

- Improved: Made the regex ever so slightly smaller.
- Updated: The readme.


### Version 1.0.2 (2015-10-18) ###

- Improved: Limited npm package contents for a smaller download. Thanks to
  @zertosh!


### Version 1.0.1 (2015-06-20) ###

- Fixed: Declared an undeclared variable.


### Version 1.0.0 (2015-02-26) ###

- Changed: Merged the 'operator' and 'punctuation' types into 'punctuator'. That
  type is now equivalent to the Punctuator token in the ECMAScript
  specification. (Backwards-incompatible change.)
- Fixed: A `-` followed by a number is now correctly matched as a punctuator
  followed by a number. It used to be matched as just a number, but there is no
  such thing as negative number literals. (Possibly backwards-incompatible
  change.)


### Version 0.4.1 (2015-02-21) ###

- Added: Support for the regex `u` flag.


### Version 0.4.0 (2015-02-21) ###

- Improved: `jsTokens.matchToToken` performance.
- Added: Support for octal and binary number literals.
- Added: Support for template strings.


### Version 0.3.1 (2015-01-06) ###

- Fixed: Support for unicode spaces. They used to be allowed in names (which is
  very confusing), and some unicode newlines were wrongly allowed in strings and
  regexes.


### Version 0.3.0 (2014-12-19) ###

- Changed: The `jsTokens.names` array has been replaced with the
  `jsTokens.matchToToken` function. The capturing groups of `jsTokens` are no
  longer part of the public API; instead use said function. See this [gist] for
  an example. (Backwards-incompatible change.)
- Changed: The empty string is now considered an âinvalidâ token, instead an
  âemptyâ token (its own group). (Backwards-incompatible change.)
- Removed: component support. (Backwards-incompatible change.)

[gist]: https://gist.github.com/lydell/be49dbf80c382c473004


### Version 0.2.0 (2014-06-19) ###

- Changed: Match ES6 function arrows (`=>`) as an operator, instead of its own
  category (âfunctionArrowâ), for simplicity. (Backwards-incompatible change.)
- Added: ES6 splats (`...`) are now matched as an operator (instead of three
  punctuations). (Backwards-incompatible change.)


### Version 0.1.0 (2014-03-08) ###

- Initial release.

[![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/eslint/eslint-visitor-keys.svg)](https://david-dm.org/eslint/eslint-visitor-keys)

Constants and utilities about visitor keys to traverse AST.

## ð¿ Installation

Use [npm] to install.

```bash
$ npm install eslint-visitor-keys
```

### Requirements

- [Node.js] `^12.22.0`, `^14.17.0`, or `>=16.0.0`


## ð Usage

To use in an ESM file:

```js
import * as evk from "eslint-visitor-keys"
```

To use in a CommonJS file:

```js
const evk = require("eslint-visitor-keys")
```

### evk.KEYS

> type: `{ [type: string]: string[] | undefined }`

Visitor keys. This keys are frozen.

This is an object. Keys are the type of [ESTree] nodes. Their values are an array of property names which have child nodes.

For example:

```
console.log(evk.KEYS.AssignmentExpression) // â ["left", "right"]
```

### evk.getKeys(node)

> type: `(node: object) => string[]`

Get the visitor keys of a given AST node.

This is similar to `Object.keys(node)` of ES Standard, but some keys are excluded: `parent`, `leadingComments`, `trailingComments`, and names which start with `_`.

This will be used to traverse unknown nodes.

For example:

```js
const node = {
    type: "AssignmentExpression",
    left: { type: "Identifier", name: "foo" },
    right: { type: "Literal", value: 0 }
}
console.log(evk.getKeys(node)) // â ["type", "left", "right"]
```

### evk.unionWith(additionalKeys)

> type: `(additionalKeys: object) => { [type: string]: string[] | undefined }`

Make the union set with `evk.KEYS` and the given keys.

- The order of keys is, `additionalKeys` is at first, then `evk.KEYS` is concatenated after that.
- It removes duplicated keys as keeping the first one.

For example:

```js
console.log(evk.unionWith({
    MethodDefinition: ["decorators"]
})) // â { ..., MethodDefinition: ["decorators", "key", "value"], ... }
```

## ð° Change log

This is an implementation of [JSON Pointer](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6901).

## CLI

Looking to filter JSON from the command line? Check out [jsonpointer-cli](https://github.com/joeyespo/jsonpointer-cli).

## Usage
```javascript
var jsonpointer = require('jsonpointer');
var obj = { foo: 1, bar: { baz: 2}, qux: [3, 4, 5]};

jsonpointer.get(obj, '/foo');     // returns 1
jsonpointer.get(obj, '/bar/baz'); // returns 2
jsonpointer.get(obj, '/qux/0');   // returns 3
jsonpointer.get(obj, '/qux/1');   // returns 4
jsonpointer.get(obj, '/qux/2');   // returns 5
jsonpointer.get(obj, '/quo');     // returns undefined

jsonpointer.set(obj, '/foo', 6);  // sets obj.foo = 6;
jsonpointer.set(obj, '/qux/-', 6) // sets obj.qux = [3, 4, 5, 6]

var pointer = jsonpointer.compile('/foo')
pointer.get(obj)    // returns 1
pointer.set(obj, 1) // sets obj.foo = 1
```

## Testing

    $ npm test
    All tests pass.
    $

These methods of collection may not be as obvious to you, so we thought weâd highlight and explain a bit</p>\r\n<p>more about what these might be (as they vary from time to time):</p>\r\n<p>Cookies and similar technologies on our websites and mobile applications allow us to track your browsing behavior, such</p>\r\n<p>as links clicked, pages viewed, and items purchased. Specifically, the data collected relates to your interactions with</p>\r\n<p>our site features or third-party features, such as social media plugins, contained within the Services; Internet</p>\r\n<p>Protocol (IP) address (for example, to determine your language preference; browser type and settings; the date and time</p>\r\n<p>the Services were used; device type and settings; operating system used; application IDs, unique device identifiers; and</p>\r\n<p>error data).

If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will</p>\r\n<p>only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.</p>\r\n\r\n<h6><strong>How we utilize information.</strong></h6>\r\n<p>We strongly believe in both minimizing the data we collect and limiting its use and purpose to only that (1) for which</p>\r\n<p>we have been given permission, (2) as necessary to deliver the Services you purchase or interact with, or (3) as we</p>\r\n<p>might be required or permitted for legal compliance or other lawful purposes:</p>\r\n<p>Delivering, improving, updating and enhancing our Services.

We want to serve you ads that are most relevant and useful to you, so we may use the personal</p>\r\n<p>information you provided us in Account Settings or those collected through cookie technologies to personalize ads and</p>\r\n<p>improve your overall experience with us on our site and other sites. We call this ad personalization (formerly,</p>\r\n<p>interest-based advertising) because the ads you see are based on previously collected or historical data to determine</p>\r\n<p>which ad will be most relevant to you, including data such as previous search queries, activity, visits to sites or</p>\r\n<p>apps, demographic information, or location. To illustrate ad personalization that is audience-based, letâs say you</p>\r\n<p>registered a domain with us and created a website using our website builder product. The next time you navigate to our</p>\r\n<p>advertising partnerâs platform or website, they may recognize that you are a Cloud 10 Solutions, LLC customer via a</p>\r\n<p>matched email and may use that data to help us display an ad about our latest promotion for website security.</p>\r\n<p>Alternatively, if you already purchased our website security product, then we may exclude you from future ad campaigns</p>\r\n<p>for this product because it wouldnât be relevant to you. Other ad personalization could be activity-based. For example,</p>\r\n<p>using data about your page views on our site to determine whether an ad would be of interest to you. The information we</p>\r\n<p>share with our advertising channel partners to deliver you personalized ads is done securely and cannot be used by them</p>\r\n<p>for any other purpose. We do not sell your data to any third parties. In addition, the data we share is hashed and</p>\r\n<p>encrypted, which means that it does not directly identify you. We do not sell your data in any way to our partners or</p>\r\n<p>other third parties.</p>\r\n<p>To manage your preferences for audience-based ad personalization, please sign into your Account and visit âAccount</p>\r\n<p>Settings.â To manage your preferences for activity-based ad personalization, please visit our Cookie Policy. and go to</p>\r\n<p>âManage Settings.â If you opt-out of ad personalization, you may continue to receive ads, but those ads may be less</p>\r\n<p>relevant to you.</p>\r\n<p>For more information about ad personalization on your desktop or mobile browser, and to opt out of this type of</p>\r\n<p>advertising by third parties that participate in self-regulatory programs, please visit one of the following: the</p>\r\n<p>Network Advertising Initiative website, the Digital Advertising Alliance (âDAAâ) website, the European Interactive</p>\r\n<p>Digital Advertising Alliance website or our Ad Choices Preference Manager.

We are not responsible for the privacy practices or the content of third-party sites. Please read the privacy policy of any website you visit.</p>\r\n<p>If you make use of a service that allows you to import contacts (ex. using email marketing services to send emails on your behalf), we will only use the contacts and any other personal information for the requested service.

Also, when you call us or initiate a chat, we may provide you with support from one of our global locations outside your country of origin.</p>\r\n<p>Compliance with legal, regulatory and law enforcement requests. We cooperate with government and law enforcement officials and private parties to enforce and comply with the law. We may disclose any information about you to government or law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate to respond to claims and legal process (such as subpoena requests), to protect our property and rights or the property and rights of a third party, to protect the safety of the public or any person, or to prevent or stop activity we consider to be illegal or unethical.</p>\r\n<p>To the extent we are legally permitted to do so, we may take reasonable steps to notify you if we are required to provide your personal information to third parties as part of legal process. We will also share your information to the extent necessary to comply with any ICANN, registry or ccTLD rules, regulations and policies when you register a domain name with us. For reasons critical to maintaining the security, stability and resiliency of the Internet, this includes the transfer of domain name registration information to the underlying domain registry operator and escrow provider, and publication of that information as required by ICANN in the public WHOIS database or with other third parties that demonstrate a legitimate legal interest to such information.</p>\r\n<h6><strong>How we secure, store and retain your data.</strong></h6>\r\n<p>We follow generally accepted standards to store and protect the personal information we collect, both during transmission and once received and stored, including utilization of encryption where appropriate. We retain personal information for as long as required to engage in the uses described in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required by applicable law.</p>\r\n<p>The criteria used to determine our retention periods include the following:</p>\r\n<p>The length of time we have an ongoing relationship with you and provide Services to you (for example, for as long as you have an account with us or keep using our Services);</p>\r\n<p>Whether account owners modify or their users delete information through their accounts;</p>\r\n<p>Whether we have a legal obligation to keep the data (for example, certain laws require us to maintain records of your transactions for a certain period of time before we can delete them); or</p>\r\n<p>Whether retention is advisable in light of our legal position (such as in regard to the enforcement of our agreements, the resolution of disputes, and applicable statutes of limitations, litigation, or regulatory investigation).</p>\r\n<h6><strong>How you can access, update or delete your data.</strong></h6>\r\n<p>To easily access, view, update, delete or port your personal information, or to update your subscription preferences, please sign into your Account and visit âAccount Settings.â Please visit our Trust Center for additional information and guidance for accessing, updating or deleting data.</p>\r\n<p>If you make a request to delete your personal information and that data is necessary for the products or services you have purchased, the request will be honored only to the extent it is no longer necessary for any Services purchased or required for our legitimate business purposes or legal or contractual record keeping requirements.</p>\r\n<p>If you are unable for any reason to access your Account Settings or our Trust Center, you may also contact us by one of the methods described in the âContact Usâ section below.</p>\r\n<h6><strong>The E.U-U.S and Swiss-U.S. Privacy Shield Frameworks.</strong></h6>\r\n<p>On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a judgment declaring as âinvalidâ the European Commissionâs Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12 July 2016 on the adequacy of the protection provided by the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield.

  //   Fork 5 of 20       Parent id
  //
  // The leading 0s are important. In the above example, you only need 3 bits to
  // represent slot 5. However, you need 5 bits to represent all the forks at
  // the current level, so we must account for the empty bits at the end.
  //
  // For this same reason, slots are 1-indexed instead of 0-indexed. Otherwise,
  // the zeroth id at a level would be indistinguishable from its parent.
  //
  // If a node has only one child, and does not materialize an id (i.e. does not
  // contain a useId hook), then we don't need to allocate any space in the
  // sequence. It's treated as a transparent indirection. For example, these two
  // trees produce the same ids:
  //
  // <>                          <>
  //   <Indirection>               <A />
  //     <A />                     <B />
  //   </Indirection>            </>
  //   <B />
  // </>
  //
  // However, we cannot skip any node that materializes an id. Otherwise, a parent
  // id that does not fork would be indistinguishable from its child id. For
  // example, this tree does not fork, but the parent and child must have
  // different ids.
  //
  // <Parent>
  //   <Child />
  // </Parent>
  //
  // To handle this scenario, every time we materialize an id, we allocate a
  // new level with a single slot. You can think of this as a fork with only one
  // prong, or an array of children with length 1.
  //
  // It's possible for the size of the sequence to exceed 32 bits, the max
  // size for bitwise operations. When this happens, we make more room by
  // converting the right part of the id to a string and storing it in an overflow
  // variable. We use a base 32 string representation, because 32 is the largest
  // power of 2 that is supported by toString(). We want the base to be large so
  // that the resulting ids are compact, and we want the base to be a power of 2
  // because every log2(base) bits corresponds to a single character, i.e. every
  // log2(32) = 5 bits. That means we can lop bits off the end 5 at a time without

Convert an object with `readonly` keys into a mutable object. Inverse of `Readonly<T>`.

This can be used to [store and mutate options within a class](https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres/blob/4a5d05fca19a5fbd2f53842cbf3eb7b1b63bddd2/source/index.ts#L72), [edit `readonly` objects within tests](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50703834), and [construct a `readonly` object within a function](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/24509).

@example
```
import {Mutable} from 'type-fest';

type Foo = {
	readonly a: number;
	readonly b: string;
};

const mutableFoo: Mutable<Foo> = {a: 1, b: '2'};
mutableFoo.a = 3;

Create a type that requires exactly one of the given keys and disallows more. The remaining keys are kept as is.

Use-cases:
- Creating interfaces for components that only need one of the keys to display properly.
- Declaring generic keys in a single place for a single use-case that gets narrowed down via `RequireExactlyOne`.

The caveat with `RequireExactlyOne` is that TypeScript doesn't always know at compile time every key that will exist at runtime. Therefore `RequireExactlyOne` can't do anything to prevent extra keys it doesn't know about.

@example
```
import {RequireExactlyOne} from 'type-fest';

type Responder = {
	text: () => string;
	json: () => string;
	secure: boolean;
};

const responder: RequireExactlyOne<Responder, 'text' | 'json'> = {
	// Adding a `text` key here would cause a compile error.

	json: () => '{"message": "ok"}',
	secure: true
};
```

# interactive-supports-focus

Elements with an interactive role and interaction handlers (mouse or key press) must be focusable.

## How do I resolve this error?

### Case: I got the error "Elements with the '${role}' interactive role must be tabbable". How can I fix this?

This element is a stand-alone control like a button, a link or a form element. A user should be able to reach this element by pressing the tab key on their keyboard.

Add the `tabIndex` property to your component. A value of zero indicates that this element can be tabbed to.

```jsx
<div
  role="button"
  tabIndex={0} />
```

-- or --

Replace the component with one that renders semantic html element like `<button>`, `<a href>` or `<input>` -- whichever fits your purpose.

Generally buttons, links and form elements should be reachable via tab key presses. An element that can be tabbed to is said to be in the _tab ring_.

### Case: I got the error "Elements with the '${role}' interactive role must be focusable". How can I fix this?

This element is part of a group of buttons, links, menu items, etc. Or this element is part of a composite widget. Composite widgets prescribe standard [keyboard interaction patterns](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#kbd_generalnav). Within a group of similar elements -- like a button bar -- or within a composite widget, elements that can be focused are given a tabindex of -1. This makes the element *focusable* but not *tabbable*. Generally one item in a group should have a tabindex of zero so that a user can tab to the component. Once an element in the component has focus, your key management behaviors will control traversal within the component's pieces. As the UI author, you will need to implement the key handling behaviors such as listening for traversal key (up/down/left/right) presses and moving the page focus between the focusable elements in your widget.

```jsx
<div role="menu">
  <div role="menuitem" tabIndex="0">Open</div>
  <div role="menuitem" tabIndex="-1">Save</div>
  <div role="menuitem" tabIndex="-1">Close</div>
</div>
```

In the example above, the first item in the group can be tabbed to. The developer provides the ability to traverse to the subsequent items via the up/down/left/right arrow keys. Traversing via arrow keys is not provided by the browser or the assistive technology. See [Fundamental Keyboard Navigation Conventions](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#kbd_generalnav) for information about established traversal behaviors for various UI widgets.

### Case: This element is not a button, link, menuitem, etc. It is catching bubbled events from elements that it contains

If your element is catching bubbled click or key events from descendant elements, then the proper role for this element is `presentation`.

```jsx
<div
  onClick={onClickHandler}
  role="presentation">
  <button>Save</button>
</div>
```

Marking an element with the role `presentation` indicates to assistive technology that this element should be ignored; it exists to support the web application and is not meant for humans to interact with directly.

## Rule details

This rule takes an options object with the key `tabbable`. The value is an array of interactive ARIA roles that should be considered tabbable, not just focusable. Any interactive role not included in this list will be flagged as needing to be focusable (tabindex of -1).

```js
{
  'jsx-a11y/interactive-supports-focus': [
    'error',
    {
      tabbable: [
        'button',
        'checkbox',
        'link',
        'searchbox',
        'spinbutton',
        'switch',
        'textbox',
      ],
    },
  ]
}
```

The recommended options list interactive roles that act as form elements. Generally, elements with a role like `menuitem` are a part of a composite widget. Focus in a composite widget is controlled and moved programmatically to satisfy the prescribed [keyboard interaction pattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#kbd_generalnav) for the widget.

The list of possible values includes:

```js
[
  'button',
  'checkbox',
  'columnheader',
  'combobox',
  'grid',
  'gridcell',
  'link',
  'listbox',
  'menu',
  'menubar',
  'menuitem',
  'menuitemcheckbox',
  'menuitemradio',
  'option',
  'progressbar',
  'radio',
  'radiogroup',
  'row',
  'rowheader',
  'searchbox',
  'slider',
  'spinbutton',
  'switch',
  'tab',
  'tablist',
  'textbox',
  'toolbar',
  'tree',
  'treegrid',
  'treeitem',
  'doc-backlink',
  'doc-biblioref',
  'doc-glossref',
  'doc-noteref',
]
```

### Succeed
```jsx
<!-- Good: div with onClick attribute is hidden from screen reader -->
<div aria-hidden onClick={() => void 0} />
<!-- Good: span with onClick attribute is in the tab order -->
<span onClick="doSomething();" tabIndex="0" role="button">Click me!</span>
<!-- Good: span with onClick attribute may be focused programmatically -->
<span onClick="doSomething();" tabIndex="-1" role="menuitem">Click me too!</span>
<!-- Good: anchor element with href is inherently focusable -->
<a href="javascript:void(0);" onClick="doSomething();">Click ALL the things!</a>
<!-- Good: buttons are inherently focusable -->
<button onClick="doSomething();">Click the button :)</button>
```

### Fail
```jsx
<!-- Bad: span with onClick attribute has no tabindex -->
<span onclick="submitForm();" role="button">Submit</span>
<!-- Bad: anchor element without href is not focusable -->
<a onclick="showNextPage();" role="button">Next page</a>
```

# import/no-mutable-exports

Forbids the use of mutable exports with `var` or `let`.

## Rule Details

Valid:

```js
export const count = 1
export function getCount() {}
export class Counter {}
```

...whereas here exports will be reported:

```js
export let count = 2
export var count = 3

let count = 4
export { count } // reported here
```

## Functions/Classes

Note that exported function/class declaration identifiers may be reassigned,
but are not flagged by this rule at this time. They may be in the future, if a
reassignment is detected, i.e.

```js
// possible future behavior!
export class Counter {} // reported here: exported class is reassigned on line [x].
Counter = KitchenSink // not reported here unless you enable no-class-assign

// this pre-declaration reassignment is valid on account of function hoisting
getCount = function getDuke() {} // not reported here without no-func-assign
export function getCount() {} // reported here: exported function is reassigned on line [x].
```

To prevent general reassignment of these identifiers, exported or not, you may
want to enable the following core ESLint rules:

- [no-func-assign]
- [no-class-assign]

[no-func-assign]: https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-func-assign
[no-class-assign]: https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-class-assign

Jest has a number of built-in matchers for comparing numbers which allow for
more readable tests and error messages if an expectation fails.

## Rule details

This rule checks for comparisons in tests that could be replaced with one of the
following built-in comparison matchers:

- `toBeGreaterThan`
- `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual`
- `toBeLessThan`
- `toBeLessThanOrEqual`

Examples of **incorrect** code for this rule:

```js
expect(x > 5).toBe(true);
expect(x < 7).not.toEqual(true);
expect(x <= y).toStrictEqual(true);
```

Examples of **correct** code for this rule:

```js
expect(x).toBeGreaterThan(5);
expect(x).not.toBeLessThanOrEqual(7);
expect(x).toBeLessThanOrEqual(y);

// special case - see below
expect(x < 'Carl').toBe(true);
```

Note that these matchers only work with numbers and bigints, and that the rule
assumes that any variables on either side of the comparison operator are of one
of those types - this means if you're using the comparison operator with
strings, the fix applied by this rule will result in an error.

```js
expect(myName).toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(theirName); // Matcher error: received value must be a number or bigint
```

The reason for this is that comparing strings with these operators is expected
to be very rare and would mean not being able to have an automatic fixer for
this rule.

If for some reason you are using these operators to compare strings, you can
disable this rule using an inline
[configuration comment](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring/rules#disabling-rules):

```js
// eslint-disable-next-line jest/prefer-comparison-matcher
expect(myName > theirName).toBe(true);

This rule enforces consistent use of semicolons after statements.

## Rule Details

This rule extends the base [`eslint/semi`](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/semi) rule.
It adds support for TypeScript features that require semicolons.

See also the [`@typescript-eslint/member-delimiter-style`](member-delimiter-style.md) rule, which allows you to specify the delimiter for `type` and `interface` members.

# schema-utils

Package for validate options in loaders and plugins.

## Getting Started

To begin, you'll need to install `schema-utils`:

```console
npm install schema-utils
```

## API

**schema.json**

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "option": {
      "type": "boolean"
    }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

```js
import schema from "./path/to/schema.json";
import { validate } from "schema-utils";

const options = { option: true };
const configuration = { name: "Loader Name/Plugin Name/Name" };

validate(schema, options, configuration);
```

### `schema`

Type: `String`

JSON schema.

Simple example of schema:

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "description": "This is description of option.",
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

### `options`

Type: `Object`

Object with options.

```js
import schema from "./path/to/schema.json";
import { validate } from "schema-utils";

const options = { foo: "bar" };

validate(schema, { name: 123 }, { name: "MyPlugin" });
```

### `configuration`

Allow to configure validator.

There is an alternative method to configure the `name` and`baseDataPath` options via the `title` property in the schema.
For example:

```json
{
  "title": "My Loader options",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "description": "This is description of option.",
      "type": "string"
    }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

The last word used for the `baseDataPath` option, other words used for the `name` option.
Based on the example above the `name` option equals `My Loader`, the `baseDataPath` option equals `options`.

#### `name`

Type: `Object`
Default: `"Object"`

Allow to setup name in validation errors.

```js
import schema from "./path/to/schema.json";
import { validate } from "schema-utils";

const options = { foo: "bar" };

validate(schema, options, { name: "MyPlugin" });
```

```shell
Invalid configuration object. MyPlugin has been initialised using a configuration object that does not match the API schema.
 - configuration.optionName should be a integer.
```

#### `baseDataPath`

Type: `String`
Default: `"configuration"`

Allow to setup base data path in validation errors.

```js
import schema from "./path/to/schema.json";
import { validate } from "schema-utils";

const options = { foo: "bar" };

validate(schema, options, { name: "MyPlugin", baseDataPath: "options" });
```

```shell
Invalid options object. MyPlugin has been initialised using an options object that does not match the API schema.
 - options.optionName should be a integer.
```

#### `postFormatter`

Type: `Function`
Default: `undefined`

Allow to reformat errors.

```js
import schema from "./path/to/schema.json";
import { validate } from "schema-utils";

const options = { foo: "bar" };

validate(schema, options, {
  name: "MyPlugin",
  postFormatter: (formattedError, error) => {
    if (error.keyword === "type") {
      return `${formattedError}\nAdditional Information.`;
    }

    return formattedError;
  },
});
```

```shell
Invalid options object. MyPlugin has been initialized using an options object that does not match the API schema.
 - options.optionName should be a integer.
   Additional Information.
```

## Examples

**schema.json**

```json
{
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "name": {
      "type": "string"
    },
    "test": {
      "anyOf": [
        { "type": "array" },
        { "type": "string" },
        { "instanceof": "RegExp" }
      ]
    },
    "transform": {
      "instanceof": "Function"
    },
    "sourceMap": {
      "type": "boolean"
    }
  },
  "additionalProperties": false
}
```

### `Loader`

```js
import { getOptions } from "loader-utils";
import { validate } from "schema-utils";

import schema from "path/to/schema.json";

function loader(src, map) {
  const options = getOptions(this);

  validate(schema, options, {
    name: "Loader Name",
    baseDataPath: "options",
  });

  // Code...
}

export default loader;
```

### `Plugin`

```js
import { validate } from "schema-utils";

import schema from "path/to/schema.json";

class Plugin {
  constructor(options) {
    validate(schema, options, {
      name: "Plugin Name",
      baseDataPath: "options",
    });

    this.options = options;
  }

  apply(compiler) {
    // Code...
  }
}

export default Plugin;
```

description: 'Enforce type definitions to consistently use either `interface` or `type`.'
---

> ð This file is source code, not the primary documentation location! ð
>
> See **https://typescript-eslint.io/rules/consistent-type-definitions** for documentation.

There are two ways to define a type.

```ts
// type alias
type T1 = {
  a: string;
  b: number;
};

// interface keyword
interface T2 {
  a: string;
  b: number;
}
```

## Options

- `"interface"` _(default)_: enforce using `interface`s for object type definitions.
- `"type"`: enforce using `type`s for object type definitions.

### `interface`

<!--tabs-->

#### â Incorrect

```ts
/* eslint @typescript-eslint/consistent-type-definitions: ["error", "interface"] */

type T = { x: number };
```

#### â Correct

```ts
/* eslint @typescript-eslint/consistent-type-definitions: ["error", "interface"] */

type T = string;
type Foo = string | {};

interface T {
  x: number;
}
```

### `type`

<!--tabs-->

#### â Incorrect

```ts
/* eslint @typescript-eslint/consistent-type-definitions: ["error", "type"] */

interface T {
  x: number;
}
```

#### â Correct

```ts
/* eslint @typescript-eslint/consistent-type-definitions: ["error", "type"] */

type T = { x: number };
```

## When Not To Use It

If you specifically want to use an interface or type literal for stylistic reasons, you can disable this rule.
var _Array$isArray = require("@babel/runtime-corejs3/core-js/array/is-array");

var arrayLikeToArray = require("./arrayLikeToArray.js");

function _maybeArrayLike(next, arr, i) {
  if (arr && !_Array$isArray(arr) && typeof arr.length === "number") {
    var len = arr.length;
    return arrayLikeToArray(arr, i !== void 0 && i < len ? i : len);
  }

  return next(arr, i);
}

module.exports = _maybeArrayLike, module.exports.__esModule = true, module.exports["default"] = module.exports;require('../../modules/es.array.iterator');

//# sourceMappingURL=brace-style.js.map# ESLint Scope

ESLint Scope is the [ECMAScript](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) scope analyzer used in ESLint. It is a fork of [escope](http://github.com/estools/escope).

## Usage

Install:

```
npm i eslint-scope --save
```

Example:

```js
var eslintScope = require('eslint-scope');
var espree = require('espree');
var estraverse = require('estraverse');

var ast = espree.parse(code);
var scopeManager = eslintScope.analyze(ast);

var currentScope = scopeManager.acquire(ast);   // global scope

estraverse.traverse(ast, {
    enter: function(node, parent) {
        // do stuff

        if (/Function/.test(node.type)) {
            currentScope = scopeManager.acquire(node);  // get current function scope
        }
    },
    leave: function(node, parent) {
        if (/Function/.test(node.type)) {
            currentScope = currentScope.upper;  // set to parent scope
        }

        // do stuff
    }
});
```

                    The resulting type of the nullish coalesce is only influenced by the right operand if the left operand can be `null` or `undefined`.
                    After removing the non-null assertion the type of the left operand might contain `null` or `undefined` and then the type of the right operand
                    might change the resulting type of the nullish coalesce.
                    See the following example:

	 *
	 *   - version: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.
	 *   - sources: An array of URLs to the original source files.
	 *   - names: An array of identifiers which can be referrenced by individual mappings.
	 *   - sourceRoot: Optional. The URL root from which all sources are relative.
	 *   - sourcesContent: Optional. An array of contents of the original source files.
	 *   - mappings: A string of base64 VLQs which contain the actual mappings.
	 *   - file: Optional. The generated file this source map is associated with.
	 *
	 * Here is an example source map, taken from the source map spec[0]:
	 *
	 *     {
	 *       version : 3,

	 * An IndexedSourceMapConsumer instance represents a parsed source map which
	 * we can query for information. It differs from BasicSourceMapConsumer in
	 * that it takes "indexed" source maps (i.e. ones with a "sections" field) as
	 * input.
	 *
	 * The first parameter is a raw source map (either as a JSON string, or already
	 * parsed to an object). According to the spec for indexed source maps, they
	 * have the following attributes:
	 *
	 *   - version: Which version of the source map spec this map is following.
	 *   - file: Optional. The generated file this source map is associated with.
	 *   - sections: A list of section definitions.
	 *
	 * Each value under the "sections" field has two fields:
	 *   - offset: The offset into the original specified at which this section
	 *       begins to apply, defined as an object with a "line" and "column"
	 *       field.
	 *   - map: A source map definition. This source map could also be indexed,
	 *       but doesn't have to be.
	 *
	 * Instead of the "map" field, it's also possible to have a "url" field
	 * specifying a URL to retrieve a source map from, but that's currently
	 * unsupported.
	 *
	 * Here's an example source map, taken from the source map spec[0], but
	 * modified to omit a section which uses the "url" field.
	 *
	 *  {
	 *    version : 3,
	 *    file: "app.js",
	 *    sections: [{
	 *      offset: {line:100, column:10},
	 *      map: {
	 *        version : 3,
	 *        file: "section.js",
	 *        sources: ["foo.js", "bar.js"],
	 *        names: ["src", "maps", "are", "fun"],
	 *        mappings: "AAAA,E;;ABCDE;"
	 *      }
	 *    }],
	 *  }
	 *
	 * The second parameter, if given, is a string whose value is the URL
	 * at which the source map was found.  This URL is used to compute the
	 * sources array.
	 *
	 * [0]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1U1RGAehQwRypUTovF1KRlpiOFze0b-_2gc6fAH0KY0k/edit#heading=h.535es3xeprgt

//# sourceMappingURL=match-path-async.test.js.map# import/no-relative-packages

Use this rule to prevent importing packages through relative paths.

It's useful in Yarn/Lerna workspaces, were it's possible to import a sibling
package using `../package` relative path, while direct `package` is the correct one.

+(fixable) The `--fix` option on the [command line] automatically fixes problems reported by this rule.

### Examples

Given the following folder structure:

```
my-project
âââ packages
â   âââ foo
â   â   âââ index.js
â   â   âââ package.json
â   âââ bar
â       âââ index.js
â       âââ package.json
âââ entry.js
```

And the .eslintrc file:
```
{
  ...
  "rules": {
    "import/no-relative-packages": "error"
  }
}
```

The following patterns are considered problems:

```js
/**
 *  in my-project/packages/foo.js
 */

import bar from '../bar'; // Import sibling package using relative path
import entry from '../../entry.js'; // Import from parent package using relative path

/**
 *  in my-project/entry.js
 */

import bar from './packages/bar'; // Import child package using relative path
```

The following patterns are NOT considered problems:

```js
/**
 *  in my-project/packages/foo.js
 */

import bar from 'bar'; // Import sibling package using package name

/**
 *  in my-project/entry.js
 */

import bar from 'bar'; // Import sibling package using package name
```
# [Deprecated] no-onchange

â ï¸ **Deprecated:** This rule is based on reports of behavior of [old browsers (eg. IE 10 and below)](https://www.quirksmode.org/dom/events/change.html#t05). In the meantime, this behavior has been corrected, both in newer versions of browsers as well as [in the DOM spec](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=969068#c2).

Enforce usage of `onBlur` over/in parallel with `onChange` on select menu elements for accessibility. `onBlur` **should** be used instead of `onChange`, unless absolutely necessary and it causes no negative consequences for keyboard only or screen reader users. `onBlur` is a more declarative action by the user: for instance in a dropdown, using the arrow keys to toggle between options will trigger the `onChange` event in some browsers. Regardless, when a change of context results from an `onBlur` event or an `onChange` event, the user should be notified of the change unless it occurs below the currently focused element.

## Rule details

This rule takes no arguments.

### Succeed
```jsx
<select onBlur={updateModel}>
  <option/>
</select>

<select>
  <option onBlur={handleOnBlur} onChange={handleOnChange} />
</select>
```

### Fail
```jsx
<select onChange={updateModel} />
```

```

## API

### ansiRegex(options?)

Returns a regex for matching ANSI escape codes.

#### options

Type: `object`

##### onlyFirst

Type: `boolean`\
Default: `false` *(Matches any ANSI escape codes in a string)*

Match only the first ANSI escape.

## FAQ

### Why do you test for codes not in the ECMA 48 standard?

Some of the codes we run as a test are codes that we acquired finding various lists of non-standard or manufacturer specific codes. We test for both standard and non-standard codes, as most of them follow the same or similar format and can be safely matched in strings without the risk of removing actual string content. There are a few non-standard control codes that do not follow the traditional format (i.e. they end in numbers) thus forcing us to exclude them from the test because we cannot reliably match them.

On the historical side, those ECMA standards were established in the early 90's whereas the VT100, for example, was designed in the mid/late 70's. At that point in time, control codes were still pretty ungoverned and engineers used them for a multitude of things, namely to activate hardware ports that may have been proprietary. Somewhere else you see a similar 'anarchy' of codes is in the x86 architecture for processors; there are a ton of "interrupts" that can mean different things on certain brands of processors, most of which have been phased out.
