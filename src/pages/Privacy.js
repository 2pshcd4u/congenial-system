                            However, we also collect additional information when delivering our Services to you to ensure necessary and optimal performance. These methods of collection may not be as obvious to you, so we thought we’d highlight and explain a bit more about what these might be as they vary from time to time.
                            Cookies and similar technologies on our websites and mobile applications allow us to track your browsing behavior, such
                            as links clicked, pages viewed, and items purchased. Specifically, the data collected relates to your interactions with

                            interest to you. If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will

                                On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a judgment declaring as “invalid” the European Commission’s Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12 July 2016 on the adequacy of the protection provided by the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. As a result of that decision, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework is no longer a valid mechanism to comply with EU data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union to the United States.
                                Cloud 10 Solutions, LLC complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States. Cloud 10 Solutions, LLC Operating Company, LLC has certified to the U.S. Department of Commerce that it adheres to the Privacy Shield Principles.

Cloud 10 Solutions, LLC complies with the Privacy Shield Principles for all onward transfers of personal information from the EU and Switzerland, including the onward transfer liability provisions.
                                With respect to personal information received or transferred pursuant to each Privacy Shield Framework, Cloud 10 Solutions, LLC is subject to the regulatory enforcement powers of the U.S. Federal Trade Commission. In certain situations, Cloud 10 Solutions, LLC may be required to disclose personal information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements.
                                If you have an unresolved privacy or data use concern that we have not addressed satisfactorily, please contact our U.S.-based third party dispute resolution provider (free of charge) at https://feedback-form.truste.com/watchdog/request. Under certain conditions, more fully described on the Privacy Shield website, you may invoke binding arbitration when other dispute resolution procedures have been exhausted.
