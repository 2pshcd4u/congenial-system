                            Much of what you likely consider personal information is collected directly from you when you create an account or purchase any of our Services ex: billing information, including name, address, credit card number, government identification;
                            request assistance from our award-winning customer support team (ex: phone number, voice recordings;

                            participate in contests and surveys, apply for a job, or otherwise participate in activities we promote that might require information about you.
                            However, we also collect additional information when delivering our Services to you to ensure necessary and optimal performance. These methods of collection may not be as obvious to you, so we thought we’d highlight and explain a bit more about what these might be as they vary from time to time.
                            Cookies and similar technologies on our websites and mobile applications allow us to track your browsing behavior, such
                            as links clicked, pages viewed, and items purchased. Specifically, the data collected relates to your interactions with

                            media platforms, or third parties from whom we have purchased data, in which case we may combine this data with
                            information we already have about you so that we can update, expand and analyze the accuracy of our records, assess the
                            qualifications of a candidate for employment, identify new customers, and provide products and services that may be of
                            interest to you. If you provide us personal information about others, or if others give us your information, we will
                            only use that information for the specific reason for which it was provided to us.

                                On July 16, 2020, the Court of Justice of the European Union issued a judgment declaring as “invalid” the European Commission’s Decision (EU) 2016/1250 of 12 July 2016 on the adequacy of the protection provided by the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield. As a result of that decision, the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework is no longer a valid mechanism to comply with EU data protection requirements when transferring personal data from the European Union to the United States.
                                Cloud 10 Solutions, LLC complies with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield Framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information transferred from the European Union to the United States.
